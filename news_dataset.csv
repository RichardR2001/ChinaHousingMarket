High-level disappearances deepen China's political black hole,[],"BEIJING: The sacking of a top diplomat and the mysterious disappearance of a defence minister have raised fresh questions around President Xi Jinping's increasingly opaque decision-making, experts say.

US officials believe defence minister Li Shangfu is under investigation and has been relieved of his duties just six months after his appointment, the Financial Times reported last week.

In July, foreign minister Qin Gang - long seen as a close ally of Xi's - was removed from office without explanation.

Later that month China announced that former navy commander Wang Houbin would take over as the new head of the Chinese military's Rocket Force, as media reports emerged of a corruption probe.

Wang's predecessor Li Yuchao had not been seen in weeks, and state media offered no explanation for his removal.

""As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, 'Something is rotten in the state of Denmark',"" US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said on X last week, adding that defence minister Li ""hasn't been seen or heard from"" in weeks.

""President Xi's cabinet lineup is now resembling Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None. First, Foreign Minister Qin Gang goes missing, then the Rocket Force commanders go missing, and now Defense Minister Li Shangfu hasn't been seen in public for two weeks,"" Emanuel wrote in a separate post.","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--Wy0hjWVI--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:afp_watermark,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2e8381ca2cd303e7f56c4d1cdebb1984f5bf582c.jpg?itok=8M3hSb-c",[],https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-political-disappearance-officials-li-shangfu-li-yuchao-qin-gang-3785341,
What we know about the Sikh murder that soured India-Canada ties,['Lee Chong Ming'],"What do we know about Nijjar's murder?

Nijjar was shot dead outside the Sikh temple where he had served as president on Jun 18 in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population.

He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and died at the scene.

His killing marked the second prominent member of the Sikh community in Canada to be murdered in two years.

Ripudaman Singh Malik, a Sikh businessman who was acquitted in connection with the 1985 Air India bombing that killed more than 300 people, was shot dead on Jul 14 last year.

A lawyer and spokesperson for Sikhs For Justice, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, said Nijjar had been a target of threats due to his activism.

Pannun said he had spoken to Nijjar by phone the day before his murder and that Nijjar had told him that Canadian intelligence had warned him that his life was at risk.

How has the assassination impacted India-Canada relations?

Relations between Canada and India soured following the Sikh leader's assassination and ensuing protests in Canada.

Canada said on Monday that there were ""credible allegations"" that agents linked to New Delhi were responsible for the murder of Nijjar.

Trudeau also said in an emergency statement to the House of Commons that any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen was ""an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty"".

He said he had raised the murder directly with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in New Delhi last week, and urged the government of India to ""cooperate with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter"".

""Canada has declared its deep concerns to the top intelligence and security officials of the Indian government. Last week at the G20 I brought them personally and directly to Prime Minister Modi in no uncertain terms,"" he said.

Canada also expelled India's top intelligence agent in the country on Monday, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said, without providing details.

India on Tuesday dismissed the accusation as ""absurd and motivated"" and in a tit-for-tat move, said it was expelling a Canadian diplomat.

The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said the leader had ""completely rejected"" Canada's assertions in the unsolved slaying.

New Delhi also urged Canada instead to take legal action against anti-Indian elements operating from its soil.

Modi had conveyed his strong concerns to Trudeau at the G20 summit over recent demonstrations in Canada by Sikhs calling for an independent state.

The Indian government accuses Ottawa of turning a blind eye to the activities of radical Sikh nationalists who advocate the creation of an independent Sikh state to be carved out of northern India.

In a sign of the simmering crisis, Ottawa recently suspended negotiations for a free-trade agreement with India, and last week the minister of trade cancelled a trip to the country planned for October.

Trudeau on Tuesday demanded that India treat with ""utmost seriousness"" Canada's allegations.

""India needs to take this matter with the utmost seriousness. We are doing that, we are not looking to provoke or escalate,"" he said.

On Wednesday, India warned its citizens against visiting parts of Canada.

Without explicitly referring to the row, India's foreign ministry said it was concerned for the safety of its citizens in Canada because of ""politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence"".

""Threats have particularly targeted Indian diplomats and sections of the Indian community who oppose the anti-India agenda,"" a ministry statement said.

""Indian nationals are therefore advised to avoid travelling to regions and potential venues in Canada that have seen such incidents.""

The advisory did not name specific cities or locations for Indians to avoid.","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--8LqMBY5T--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2023-09-19t012921z_1_lynxmpej8i015_rtroptp_3_canada-india.jpg?itok=KhGokW1B",[],https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/india-canada-sikh-murder-hardeep-singh-nijjar-khalistan-movement-what-we-know-3784916,
Commentary: India needs to take Sikh leader's murder in Canada seriously,['Mihir Sharma'],"NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s dramatic statement in parliament that there were “credible allegations” Indian intelligence was behind the murder of a radical Sikh activist in British Columbia came as a shock to many in India for a couple of reasons. For one thing, most of us still believe that we’re the good guys and our government doesn’t do this kind of thing.

More importantly, if India actually did conduct an assassination on Western soil - which its foreign ministry strongly denies - it would represent a pretty major escalation of the country’s covert struggle against both non-violent dissidents and active supporters of militant separatism abroad. Even the most fervent supporters of the government’s muscular approach to foreign policy should have qualms about that possibility.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long pledged to change India’s traditionally quietist approach to international relations. After a terrorist attack in Kashmir in 2019, he declared in a much-quoted campaign speech that his policy was to “barge into (their) homes and kill them.”

Everyone knew that he meant, in particular, the homes of extremists living abroad.

That was followed quickly by an air force raid into Pakistani territory that targeted a supposed terrorist training centre. The mission was wildly popular: Leaders in Modi’s party argued that it helped them sweep general elections a few weeks later.","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--pICA8p1l--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2023-09-18t222936z_1_lynxmpej8h0sa_rtroptp_3_canada-india.jpg?itok=qUkWu94x",[],https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/india-canada-sikh-leader-nijjar-murder-investigation-cooperate-3785171,
Commentary: Why is Beijing sensitive about clothes that ‘hurt the feelings of the Chinese nation’?,"['Tiong Wei Jie', 'Li Mingjiang']","SINGAPORE: China’s push to revise its public security law in late August has generated heated debate in the country. One of the proposed additions, if passed, would allow law enforcers to punish people who wear clothing or symbols in public that ""undermine the spirit"" or ""hurt the feelings of the Chinese nation”.

Critics say that such a law would be unnecessarily and unacceptably intrusive in private life. They challenge the proposal by asking who decides whether the feelings of the Chinese people are hurt and what standard should be used to make such a judgment.

At the same time, some netizens have shown strong support for the legal amendment on social media channels such as Weibo.

There have been recent controversial incidents over the clothing of Chinese citizens. In March, videos of a groomsman from central China donning a replica of the Japanese military uniform from World War II circulated online, sparking outrage from Chinese netizens and condemnation from local government officials. The backlash was understandable as the outfit evoked painful memories from China’s history.

A more debatable incident happened in August last year, where a Chinese woman was detained in Suzhou by the police for wearing a kimono, a traditional Japanese garment, in public.

More consequentially, a commercial street in Dalian featuring Japanese culture, architecture and cuisine was closed soon after it began operations in September 2021 due to nationwide criticism.

THE DELICATE TASK OF DEFINING UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOUR

These incidents demonstrate the delicate task faced by Chinese authorities to demarcate, reasonably, what constitutes as behaviours that may hurt national dignity.","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--_os-L-4A--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2023-09-11t054845z_2_lynxmpej8a042_rtroptp_3_china-economy-consumption-wholesale.jpg?itok=PH-y0EAl",[],https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-ban-clothes-hurt-feelings-nation-draft-law-public-security-japan-west-3785296,
Syria's Assad visits China seeking funds,[],"HANGZHOU: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday (Sep 21) began his first official trip to China in almost two decades, state media reported, where he will ask a long-time ally for financial support to help rebuild his devastated country.

China becomes one of only a handful of countries outside the Middle East that Assad has visited since the 2011 start of a war that has since killed more than half a million people, displaced millions more and battered Syria's infrastructure and industry.

Assad also becomes the latest in a string of leaders ostracised by the West to be feted by Beijing, with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, as well as top Russian officials, all visiting this year.

He arrived on Thursday in the eastern city of Hangzhou, where he will attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games on Saturday.

The Syrian president's Air China plane was greeted on the tarmac by jubilant music and rows of performers wearing colourful costumes, as Chinese and Syrian flags flapped in the sky, footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed.

According to the Syrian presidency, he will also visit Beijing.

The visit will be Assad's first to China since 2004.

Beijing has long provided Damascus with diplomatic support, particularly at the United Nations Security Council where it is a permanent member.

Officials from both countries have also made visits over the years.

""This visit represents an important rupture in the diplomatic isolation and the political siege imposed on Syria,"" Damascus-based political scientist Oussama Dannoura told AFP.

""China has been breaking Western taboos that seek to prevent a number of states from dealing with countries that Washington considers isolated,"" he added.","https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--vNKkeQJN--/c_crop,h_432,w_768,x_0,y_56/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:afp_watermark,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/8f416ce828f9dc42291beaafd633fb92dfd9aa72.jpg?itok=Y9Tm_ino",[],https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/bashar-al-assad-syrian-president-china-seeking-funds-3787706,
Chinese navy seeks graduate students for warplane pilot roles,[],"BEIJING: The Chinese navy wants to hire highly educated graduate students to fly shipborne aircraft, and is raising the age limit to expand its search, as it seeks to improve the qualifications of its air personnel and build a ""strong army"".

Besides upgrading its hardware from warships to warplanes, China is also trying to improve the calibre of its recruits, as the military is a career path traditionally favoured by the less educated.

In an advertisement on the social media platform WeChat, the People's Liberation Army Navy said it was seeking graduate students who hold science and engineering master degrees and who are below 26 years old to pilot aircraft from ships, including China's growing fleet of aircraft carriers.

Just last year, it allowed undergraduates aged 24 or below to apply for the first time. It limited candidates to high school graduates aged below 20 before that.

""The need for high-quality military talent becomes more imperative day by day,"" the People's Liberation Army Navy said in the advert, published on Wednesday (Sep 20).

""The mission and tasks of the navy continue to expand. The speed of the strategic shift of the navy is being accelerated.""

Candidates must be male with a clean ""political history"" and have no legal or disciplinary history, according to the advertisement.

Training will include three to four years of aviation theory studies and practical flight training. Successful candidates will have free medical care for themselves and their immediate family, as well as government-provided housing.

China is in the final stages of preparing its third, but first domestically made, aircraft carrier - the Fujian - for sea trials, a key step before the warship goes into operational service.
