REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo 19 Sep 2023 01:45PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: Chinese developers Country Garden and Sunac brought some relief to the crisis-hit property sector by forging debt deals with creditors, but the outlook remained clouded by uncertainty about a recovery in home sales.Shares in Sunac China Holdings surged as much as 14 per cent on Tuesday (Sep 19) after creditors approved its US$9 billion offshore debt restructuring plan, the first green light of such a debt overhaul by a major Chinese developer.Separately, cash-starved Country Garden won approval from creditors to extend repayment on another onshore bond, the last in the batch of eight bonds it has been seeking extensions for, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The developments come as Beijing steps up efforts to revive the property sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the world's second-largest economy, with a raft of support measures unveiled over the last few weeks.Sunac said late on Monday that creditors holding 98.3 per cent of the total value of the bonds who attended the vote had approved the restructuring plan proposed and agreed to by some creditors in March. The developer will seek approval of the plan by a Hong Kong court at a hearing scheduled for Oct 5.As part of the restructuring terms, a portion of its debt would be exchanged into convertible bonds backed by its Hong Kong-listed shares along with new notes with maturities of between two and nine years.""I will treat it as a positive ... We haven't seen much progress on the offshore market, so this shows at least some Chinese developers are trying to reach an agreement,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank.If the plan could be implemented well, and depending on whether the recovery of China's property market could generate sufficient cash flows, investors would be able to get something back, he added.Related:After Country Garden debt deal, focus shifts to China property recovery prospectsHong Kong-listed shares of Sunac were up more than 4 per cent at 0310 GMT, while Country Garden was trading 1 per cent higher.While Sunac is among a string of Chinese developers that have defaulted on their offshore debt obligations since an unprecedented liquidity crisis hit the property sector in 2021, Country Garden has not missed any offshore payments yet.PROPERTY SECTOR OUTLOOKMajor developers in the process of restructuring their debt include China Evergrande Group, whose liquidity crunch was a turning point in the country's real estate crisis.The latest debt deals with creditors will give some breathing room to Chinese developers and help them avoid a default or a messy liquidation process, but the success of the agreements will depend on a recovery in the property sector.Even as Beijing implements measures to prop up the sector, house prices have continued to decline - latest data show new home prices fell at their fastest pace in 10 months in August, while falls in real estate investment and sales deepened.ANZ Senior China Economist Betty Wang said the support measures could spur some ""genuine demand"" especially ahead of the traditional sale season during late September/early October in top-tier cities.""However, the pace and the extent of such a turnaround will be much smaller than in previous cycles,"" she said in a report published on Tuesday.""It's also questionable whether it will kick off a sustainable rebound especially considering the uncertain job outlook, deteriorating income inflows, a shift in expectations, and potential increase in housing supply in the long-term.""

(AP Photo/Louise Delmotte) Zhiyong Yang Zhiyong Yang 16 Sep 2023 06:00AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn OXFORD, Ohio: Once upon a time - in 2019 - tourists from China were among the best-travelled in the world. They collectively spent more than US$250 billion abroad - nearly twice as much as their nearest competitors, the Americans - and logged more than 150 million departures on international flights that year.The COVID-19 pandemic shook the Chinese travel industry, as it did the world’s. But despite the easing of pandemic restrictions - and a global tourism rebound - Chinese tourists have been slow to return to the global skies. The reason, interestingly enough, could be found in the very land and houses Chinese planes fly over.As a professor of marketing who specialises in consumer psychology, I’m interested in how China’s struggling real estate sector is dragging down consumer spending - and having an effect on tourist destinations around the world.REAL PROPERTY, REAL PROBLEMSTo understand the issue, first you need to understand China’s current real estate crisis. Just how bad is it? China’s largest developer, Country Garden, lost US$7.1 billion in the first six months of 2023; investors concerned about potential debt default have sent its stock plummeting.Another major developer, the troubled China Evergrande Group, posted a US$4.5 billion loss over the same period and sought bankruptcy protection in the US last month. It gained international attention in 2021 after it defaulted on US$300 billion of debt, sparking the current crisis.One major - if indirect - reason China’s real estate industry is so shaky is that local governments are heavily dependent on tax revenue from land sales, as well as property taxes and real estate development fees. At the same time, about 70 per cent of the general population’s assets are invested in real estate.Those facts enticed developers and local governments alike to borrow excessively to fund new development. When the central government started to implement more stringent regulations to curb speculation and control prices, the market predictably cooled - and has kept cooling.In July, new home sales from China’s top 100 developers were down 33 per cent from the previous year. Prices are slumping, too.This has had a cascade of effects on the Chinese economy. Most immediately, as demand for construction materials and labor has fallen, hiring has cooled and consumers are tightening their belts. Local governments are also struggling to stay afloat with less revenue, with some provinces being forced to slash government salaries and benefits.WHY STAYCATIONS SUDDENLY APPEALThe situation is especially challenging for homeowners, who are burdened with shrinking wealth as housing prices fall. This has had a ripple effect on spending, as cautious consumers increasingly prioritise their savings - worsening the economic challenge for businesses across the country.Unsurprisingly - at least to anyone who’s paid attention to the world economy - what happens in China doesn’t stay in China. And the global tourism industry has been hit particularly hard as newly budget-conscious Chinese homeowners pare back their spending.Related:She has a master’s but no job and lives on discount coupons.

Chinese tourism to popular European destinations such as France, Switzerland, Greece and Spain has also fallen sharply.All in all, China’s outbound travel spending is forecast to be down nearly 70 per cent this year from its pre-pandemic peak.To be fair, tourism within China is bouncing back - to a degree - as frugal travellers increasingly opt to vacation closer to home. The China Tourism Academy predicts that domestic tourism will hit 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in 2023. But that alone won’t offset the impact of lower consumer confidence. Part of the reason is that the amount of money travellers are willing to spend is down.And faced with demand challenges as well as the effects of COVID-19 and geopolitical strife, Chinese travel agencies have been shuttering en masse in recent years. From January to April 2022, about 8,500 tourism agents and firms declared bankruptcy. Even assuming some reopen, that churn and disruption bode ill for the sector.Global tourism has faced a challenging few years, with the pandemic and increased fuel costs putting off would-be travellers. With Chinese consumers feeling down in the dumps over the economy and opting for modest vacations, a recovery will be that much harder.Zhiyong Yang is Professor of Marketing at Miami University.

(Illustration: SCMP/Henry Wong)Economists say alternative high-frequency data points – from subway ridership to commodity prices – suggest parts of China’s economy are functioning wellEconomic downturn seen shrinking nation’s middle class, but while some say China may not be in a crisis, its economy is ""not out of the woods, yet"" South China Morning Post South China Morning Post 15 Sep 2023 10:27AM (Updated: 15 Sep 2023 10:35AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn As the hits kept coming, marring China’s battered businesses with fresh bruises over the past month, the discourse surrounding an economic crisis grew louder, and the headlines more prominent.International banks lowered their annual growth forecasts for the world’s second-largest economy; the yuan’s rate against the US dollar kept falling; Beijing suspended the release of dismal youth unemployment figures; and the country’s largest private property developer, Country Garden, warned that it is on the brink of default.Mistrust from the public and overseas investors over Beijing’s official narrative is also growing, even as Beijing has repeatedly vowed to crack down on statistical fraud.But despite the negative sentiment, some economists point to alternative high-frequency data points – from subway ridership to commodity prices – that suggest many parts of China’s economy are functioning well.However, data on the real estate sector – the single biggest contributor to the country’s economy, as it constitutes about 30 per cent of GDP – still points to no meaningful improvement, despite rounds of stimulus policies from Beijing, they said.“The bottom line is that China’s economy is not out of the woods, yet. But it’s not in crisis, either,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.He said growth remains lacklustre due to the drag from property and weak confidence, while high-frequency data suggests that the economy has stabilised at a low level.“Contrary to the prevailing narrative of an imminent recession or even implosion, the Chinese economy is showing more signs of stabilisation rather than further deterioration,” Hu said. “Policy actions over the past month have been in line with the pro-growth pivot at the July Politburo meeting, although policymakers need to act more decisively to pull the housing market out of its ongoing downward spiral.”During the tone-setting meeting, China’s leadership for the first time in years dropped the phrase “houses are for living in, not for speculation”, pointing to a pro-growth shift in the property sector. So far, a slew of relaxing measures – from reducing down payments to scrapping the requirement of “no mortgage records” for identifying “first-home buyers” – have been implemented.The Nanhua industrial product price index, a measure of domestic commodity prices reflecting the demand for industrial and infrastructure investment, grew by 2.5 per cent in August, after rising 6.6 per cent in July. (Source: Nanhua Futures, Wind) “So, the infrastructure investment is probably picking up, and China’s economy – looking from the perspective of commodity demand – is still functioning, it’s more like a soft patch than a hard landing or crash,” Hu said.According to a sentiment index compiled by French investment bank Natixis via posts on Chinese social media and news reports, economic uncertainty has gradually eased since June, when the rapid depreciation of the yuan and stock market fluctuations took a heavy toll on confidence.As for investment sentiment, while remaining low this year, it has still improved compared with earlier this year. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, has improved steadily and moderately since the start of 2023, with similar trends seen in industries such as food, automotive and fashion, Natixis data showed.One of the biggest spotlights has been luxury goods sales. As the world’s second-largest luxury market, China has made a solid comeback since the start of the year, after a blip in 2022 due to stringent zero-COVID lockdowns.According to data from Sandalwood, a global alternative data platform, China’s domestic offline luxury consumption in July increased by 46 per cent compared with the same time last year – when Shanghai was yet to emerge from a citywide lockdown – and also rose by 17 per cent compared with July 2021.The main reason for the robust luxury sales in China this year is that the impact of the pandemic on high-income groups is relatively small – a phenomenon also seen in other countries, said Ying Zhang, a research analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.“The impact of the economic downturn may be more obvious in terms of the shrinking middle class,” she said.RelatedAs China’s property crisis plagues its economy and financial system, is a ‘Lehman moment’ looming?China’s too-big-to-fail property giants the tip of real estate crisis as ‘suppliers are being dragged to death’Apart from a divergence among different income groups, China’s consumption trend this year is polarised among sectors, as service consumption such as concerts, tourism and catering have been better than the sale of goods – which has been more suppressed by worsening income prospects, Zhang said.Sandalwood data showed that the total booking value on two major Chinese travel platforms, Trip.com and Tongcheng Travel, hit a record high in July, thanks to the high demand during the summer holiday.Despite the slightly weakening momentum in August, it still maintained double-digit growth: in the first half of August, bookings on Trip.com increased by 85 per cent by value, year on year, and on Tongcheng Travel they increased by 60 per cent.In some major cities, the subway passenger volume has also been well above pre-pandemic levels in the past few months, though that of the top three metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have yet to fully recover to 2019’s level, according to data compiled by Wind, a Chinese financial data provider.The summer box office data also reached a new historical high this year. According to movie industry data provider Dengta, the box office in China from June to August reached 20.62 billion yuan (US$2.83 billion), compared with the previous record of 17.78 billion yuan achieved in 2019.But such high-frequency data is highly impacted by incidental factors, such as the timing of festivals, said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura.“For the box office, it is highly related to the movies that are on show, so we tend to not jump to any conclusion on the economy just based on the box office,” he said, adding that movie ticket prices are also higher than before the pandemic.And the surge in subway ridership is also related to the growing infrastructure construction in the past years – with new metro lines appearing in Chinese cities, Lu added.Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, said the surge in consumer spending in tourism and entertainment – which are heavily driven by a pent-up need to get out and de-stress after COVID-19 lockdowns – is unlikely to be sustainable.“With low shares and low growth, those segments were never pillars of China’s economy, despite being highly visible,” she said. “Ultimately, those non-essential consumptions are constrained by household income, which is determined by overall economic growth.”For China’s economy, she added: “If you are looking at any place other than housing, you are wasting your time.”Economists from Capital Economics, measuring growth by tracking China’s industrial output, construction activity, traffic volume, property and car sales and electricity consumption, said the economy regained some ground in July, following a contraction in June.“But the big picture is that output has levelled off recently and that the economy could tip into a downward spiral unless policy support is ramped up soon,” they said in a note in late August.“Troubles in the property sector will weigh on confidence among homebuyers and firms for some time. And the risks to exports remain skewed to the downside. The government has responded with some policy support. But it remains too timid and slow-moving.”High-frequency data on the property sector, such as the volume of new home sales in major cities, has remained weak and shown little improvement, despite Beijing’s relaxing measures, economists said.Also read:China's concertgoers splash the cash, but is revenge spending sustainable to rock the economy?‘Hang on to cash’: China’s would-be homebuyers opt to wait out housing downturnChina’s current weak labour market and high youth unemployment suggest cyclical problems, and that the economy is running below potential growthThe deepest property downturn in history certainly reflects changes in long-term fundamentals, to a certain degree, but it was also driven by earlier policy tightening and was aggravated by the pandemic and lockdowns, according to Wang Tao, head of China Economic Research at UBS.“Notwithstanding demographic challenges in the long term, China’s current weak labour market and high youth unemployment suggest cyclical problems, and that the economy is running below potential growth,” she said in a note last week.Wang Tao added that one of the causes of the weaker-than-expected stimulus policies from Beijing is a delayed comprehension of the weakness in China’s economy, mainly due to the uneven recovery reflected in data from different sectors – from the strong domestic travel rebound to the worsening property market – since the second quarter.“What could trigger a larger and more comprehensive policy response from here,” she mulled. “While we do not think the high youth unemployment is an imminent threat to social stability, the worsening of economic data – including on property construction, industrial production, retail sales and exports – could mean more challenges in the overall labour market, in corporate health, and in local government operations.“As such, we expect weak data leading to more policy actions in the coming month.”This article was first published on SCMP.

Employers are increasingly asking for a master’s degree, even when roles do not justify it. The programme Insight finds out how Chinese youths are coping.Lingshan lives in an 8 sq m apartment and relies on livestreaming to eke out a living. Lianne Chia @LianneChiaCNA Wei Du @WeiDuCNA Andersen Xia Lianne Chia , Wei Du & Andersen Xia 09 Sep 2023 06:00AM (Updated: 11 Oct 2023 02:21PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn NANJING: In 2015, when Lingshan was deciding what to study in university, China’s property market was booming and civil engineering seemed a lucrative choice.Fast forward seven years and Lingshan, who graduated with a master’s degree last year, is in an awkward situation. She has been unemployed for a year and is living in an apartment merely 8 square metres in size in the eastern city of Nanjing.“Why did I study civil engineering? Oh my, that was stupid,” said Lingshan, who asked to be identified by her online alias.“I’d wanted to work for a real estate developer, but by the time I graduated, they were going bust one after another,” she recalled.“I was hit in the face by the downturn.”China’s property crisis unfolded when developer Evergrande, which had over US$300 billion (S$410 billion) in liabilities, defaulted in 2021. Since then, companies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales have defaulted, reported Reuters, and the crisis has now engulfed another major developer, Country Garden.According to Chinese media reports, the country’s top 50 property developers cut 200,000 jobs last year. With many homes unfinished and property prices continuing to decline, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. With her civil engineering master’s degree, Lingshan hoped for a job with a real estate developer but graduated at a time when they were “going bust one after another”. Lingshan recently received another reality check from an employment consultant. “If you still want to stay in civil engineering, your resume is a bit awkward,” the consultant, Xu Hongfei, told her.“First, you’re a woman, so you can’t work at construction sites. Normally they hire men to do that,” he continued. “Also, most companies would only recruit from the graduating class. Right now, that’s the Class of 2024, and you graduated in 2022.”China’s unemployment data and social media chatter show Lingshan is not alone in her predicament.Urban unemployment of those aged 16 to 24 rose to a record high of 21.3 per cent in June, and a cohort of 11.6 million students finished tertiary education this summer to enter what’s possibly the toughest job market in recent history.According to an analysis by news provider CNBC of Chinese state media reports, a record 7.7 million people took the civil service exam in this year’s application round, vying for over 200,000 government jobs at the national and provincial level. The official statistics may also not paint a full picture. For one, there are people originally from rural areas who, when unable to find employment in cities, would return to their hometowns, said Bert Hofman, director of the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute.“As such, they aren’t measured as unemployed in urban areas,” he said.Last month, the Chinese government said it would temporarily stop releasing data on youth unemployment, citing the need to “further improve and optimise labour force survey statistics”.WATCH: China’s youth unemployment at record highs — Meet the jobless graduates (46:08)‘IT KEEPS GETTING MORE COMPETITIVE’The cut-throat competition for jobs has led to Xu receiving new enquiries weekly. He helps fresh graduates navigate the job market and is currently working with 200 paying clients.When he left school in 2009, China was producing about half the number of graduates each year than now, he told the programme Insight.“It keeps getting more competitive,” he said. There are only so many jobs. You went to a good school? I went to a better school. You did a good internship? I did a better internship. That’s the competition.” Employers are increasingly demanding at least a master’s degree for office jobs, even when the position hardly justifies it.“To an employer, hiring is costly,” said Xu. An employer may have this perspective: “I don’t have a lot of time to spend on hiring, I’m busy. So I’ll only pick among the master’s (degree holders),” Xu explained.“Of course, I know some bachelor’s (degree holders) are also outstanding, but employers have no time to discover (them).” Employment consultant Xu Hongfei has 200 paying clients. Besides China’s zero-COVID policy and weaker-than-expected post-COVID recovery, Zhang Yifan, a professor from the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s (CUHK) department of economics, pointed to “questionable economic policies” that have made the job market tougher for youths.These include the regulatory crackdown on property developers’ accumulation of debt, which led to the implosion of the housing market, as well as curbs on the after-school tuition industry in a bid to reduce academic stress.The authorities also clamped down on influential tech companies like Tencent and Alibaba.“These industries all used to be very vibrant, and absorbed a lot of young workers,” said Zhang. Large private education company New Oriental Education Group, for instance, laid off more than 60,000 workers in 2021, he cited.Related stories:‘Not just about receiving a salary’: Why some adults in China have become ‘full-time’ childrenTo reduce academic stress, China banned private tuition. Has the policy backfired?ONLINE MEMES AND SCARRING EFFECTSYoung jobseekers’ frustrations have been laid bare on social media. They have generated internet memes likening themselves to a fictional failed scholar named Kong Yiji, spawning the term “Kong Yiji literature” as well as a rap song that was swiftly censored by the government.Earlier this year, graduating master’s student Xiami posted an online video about his fruitless hunt.“I went to a job fair today, and it destroyed my last shred of confidence. Just look at the enormous amount of people there. The last time I saw this many people was when I went to do a COVID-19 test,” he said.It went viral, garnering close to half a million views on video site Bilibili.“I don’t think it was me (who) went viral, it was the difficulties of finding a job,” he told Insight. The sentiment had been brewing for a while. It just needed a spark to explode, and I was the spark.” Xiami, who asked to be known by an alias, is the son of farmers in Shandong who moved to Shanghai for his studies — one of the few in his village to do so.He started his job search in February and sent “at least 200” resumes to potential employers.“I was initially optimistic,” said Xiami, who studied Chinese literature. “I thought I could find a job in three months. But six months later, I still couldn’t land anything.“I remember thinking — it’s time to wake up, there’s no future for me.”Xiami eventually landed a job as a management trainee with a parcel delivery company. He earns less than 10,000 yuan (S$1,860) a month and, as a start, will work as a rider.“I’ve taken it in stride,” he said simply. “At least I have a way forward.” Master’s graduate Xiami sent out “at least 200” resumes to potential employers. Beyond the venting of unhappiness online, rising youth unemployment could pose a risk to China’s social and political stability.Observers note that at 21.3 per cent, China’s youth unemployment rate is just below the 23.4 per cent in the Arab region in 2010.High youth unemployment was “one of the factors contributing to the Arab Spring”, noted Zhang, the professor from CUHK, referring to the series of uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011.There are also “strong links” between youth unemployment and social issues like drug abuse and crime. “It goes beyond the young people themselves and is very costly to society,” he said.There are also ramifications on China’s economy.There is a “scarring effect” from being out of employment for an extended spell. “(Their) skills may be obsolete after a long period of unemployment,” Zhang said. “It’ll have a long-lasting effect on the future.“Their income won’t be able to recover to the normal level, even with 10 or 15 years of work experience.”The youth account for about 20 per cent of consumption in China, said Louise Loo, China economist with Oxford Economics. “A big (source) of consumption is out of the workforce,” she said. “So that does affect the extent to which consumption can be a driver for growth in the long term.”The authorities have rolled out various measures to boost youth employment. Anhui and Guizhou provinces have asked state-owned enterprises to ensure at least half of their new hires are fresh graduates, news outlet South China Morning Post reported last month.In Hunan province, graduate recruitment has been added to the annual performance appraisals for executives in state companies, it reported.Henan province came up with a 100-day plan from May to August to “dynamically clear” youth unemployment. Measures included promoting jobs in public institutions and state-owned enterprises, second degrees, and grassroots or rural employment projects, Reuters reported. Jobseekers at a job fair in China. The Chinese authorities have rolled out various measures to boost youth employment. ‘CAN’T EVEN SUPPORT YOURSELF’China’s youth unemployment situation highlights mismatches in skills and between the expectations of youths and employers.Qiang, who is from China’s southwest, recently graduated in eldercare — a relevant skill in a rapidly ageing country. But he is no longer keen on putting his degree to use. “It pays too little, and the hours are long,” he said.“You need to be on standby 24 hours a day and do night shifts. When on probation, the salary is only 1,500 to 2,000 yuan,” he said. “Even when you’re confirmed, you get paid 3,000 yuan at most.”Bantering with friends over a meal, one of them quipped: “Become a care worker? Who’s going to marry you? You want to be single forever? With the salary of a care worker, you can’t even afford to have a cat.”Another friend piped up: “Can’t even support yourself, forget about the cat.”Qiang’s parents, who own two restaurants, had hoped to help him open his own care centre after he graduated. But after three years of COVID-19 lockdowns, they no longer have the financial ability to do so. Qiang no longer wants to work in eldercare owing to the low pay and long hours. “As countries grow into becoming a middle-income economy, and aspire to be a high-income economy, the expectations of people also change,” said Maria Ana Lugo, a senior economist at the World Bank. Youths have higher expectations than their parents did back in the day and expect a certain level of income and type of work.People entering the labour force now are far better educated than those leaving the labour force, added Hofman.“(Those) leaving the labour force now, they’ve got about six to seven years of education. (Those) entering the labour force, they have about 12 years of education.”This will be good for China’s growth in the medium term, he said. But in the shorter term, there might be some issues of frictional unemployment and temporary “over-education”.Related stories:China’s Gen Z graduates pushed into cleaning jobs as it’s ‘better than staying home’As more Chinese graduates explore rural jobs, comparisons with Mao Zedong's campaign fail to pass muster‘THE FACTORY DIDN’T NEED MORE WORKERS’If graduates are feeling demoralised, their peers with associate degrees or less are even more daunted.After speaking to some recruiters at a job fair in Ningxia, Ma Youhu, who has a three-year associate degree from a tertiary vocational training institution and past experience working in electronics factories, lamented: “Even bachelor’s (degree holders) can’t find jobs, let alone me. … That’s the reality. There’s nothing I can do.”His younger brother, Cunjun, graduated from high school in July and ventured to Xiamen in search of a job.He had done a previous stint at a factory in Xiamen that made cameras for iPhones. “In the first month, I got paid 4,000 yuan. Then it went up to 5,000 yuan. I gave 10,000 yuan to my family and bought myself a phone,” he recounted. “When I went back this year, the factory didn’t need more workers.”As some Western economies teeter on a recession and more countries seek to “de-risk” their economic dependence on China, the country’s exports have taken a hit and fallen year on year every month since May.Cunjun has tried farming, but his home in Xihaigu, on the Loess Plateau, is one of the driest places in China. Ma Cunjun in the countryside. He has not had much luck finding work this year. With China’s Ministry of Education forecasting a shortage of nearly 30 million manufacturing workers by 2025, Cunjun may well find his way back to a factory in future.For now, he has a job at a construction site in Yinchuan, Ningxia’s capital, and was paid 300 yuan on his first day.The search continues for his brother Youhu, as it does for Lingshan.She has turned to livestreaming to pay the bills, putting her life on display for tips. A recent session bagged her over 20 yuan. “Thank you for feeding me,” she told her audience. “I want to buy a bowl of instant noodles. I can even afford to add some meat.” Lingshan has turned to livestreaming to eke out a living for now. While she waits for online superstardom, she hunts for discounts and uses coupons on the online shopping platform Taobao, doing what she can to stretch her money.“I try to lower consumption in every possible way,” she said.“I don’t socialise or eat out. I don’t want an apartment or to get married. I just need some food to subsist.”Watch this episode of Insight here.

Whether China can implement deeper reform to its household registration system will serve as a litmus test as to whether Beijing’s commitment to common prosperity is real, says a political risk analyst.A woman uses an umbrella to shade a child while passing through the financial center in Shanghai, Tuesday, July 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Henry Storey Henry Storey 08 Sep 2023 06:02AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn MELBOURNE: Across July and August, the province of Zhejiang and China’s central government announced significant changes to the country’s hukou - household registration - system. These reforms are undoubtedly a net positive, yet there remains little indication that Beijing is serious about undertaking the reforms required to facilitate wholesale changes to the system.Established in its modern form in 1958, the hukou system determines where residents can access credit, government jobs, education, subsidised housing, welfare and other social services.The system’s most basic categorisation was traditionally between urban and rural status. Over time, the divide has shifted to encompass “city walls”, where individuals have hukou status in one city but not others. Most of China’s almost 400 million migrant workers living in larger cities do not have local hukou.The system enshrines and indeed perpetuates China’s sharp urban-rural divide and inter-provincial inequalities. And because hukou status is often inherited, the children of itinerant workers typically lack access to public education where they live. Almost 70 per cent of Chinese children have rural hukou.The poor quality of many rural and so-called migrant schools has been identified by Western scholars such as Scott Rozelle as a serious threat to China’s ability to transition from middle-income status. The precarious existence of migrant families lacking urban hukou also acts as a considerable drag on China’s already parsimonious consumption rates.Chinese officials and academia have long been intimately aware of these broader issues. Yet this awareness has generally failed to translate into more than piecemeal reform. Even modest targets to reduce the percentage of internal migrants lacking hukou status in their primary place of residence have fallen well short. The hukou system enshrines and perpetuates China’s sharp urban-rural divide and inter-provincial inequalities. (Photo: AFP) ENCOURAGING EARLY SIGNSHence, Zhejiang’s recent reforms are notable. Under changes effective from Jul 22, Zhejiang residents will be able to apply for hukou status where they habitually reside. This change will apply for at least five years and will cover the entire province except for the capital Hangzhou.Zhejiang is not the first province to remove restrictions. Shandong, Jiangxi and Hainan undertook similar reforms in 2014, 2021 and 2022 respectively. The hope is that, as an influential province intimately connected with President Xi Jinping’s career and as a “common prosperity demonstration zone”, Zhejiang’s reforms will have more of a nationwide impact.Early signs were ostensibly encouraging. On Aug 3, the Ministry of Public Security called on local governments to abolish hukou restrictions in cities with fewer than 3 million people and relax them in those with 3 million to 5 million.The envisaged benefits of these changes go beyond combating inequality and reviving consumption and human capital accumulation. They also include facilitating further urbanisation, as well as bolstering flatlining total factor productivity, real estate markets and birth rates.Unfortunately, there is still considerable room for scepticism. It will be instructive to see what percentage of applicants in Zhejiang are awarded an urban hukou. Experiences in other provinces show a strong preference among local officials to favour wealthy or skilled migrants.Far from being novel, the Ministry of Public Security’s call echoes similar policy statements issued by the National Development and Reform Commission in 2020, 2021 and 2022. That even this relatively unambitious policy has met evident pushback points to the endurance of entrenched local government opposition which, even in Xi’s China, is difficult to overcome.Related:Commentary: Will Xi Jinping's 'common prosperity' survive Vladimir Putin's war?Commentary: Xi Jinping’s ‘common prosperity’ looks more like populism rather than socialismOBSTACLES TO REFORMLocal obstacles range from the relatively trite to more fundamental issues with China’s political economy. In China, as elsewhere, residents of larger cities are reluctant to share their relative (if not absolute) prosperity. Timing matters too, with a slowing economy and youth unemployment of more than 46 per cent on some metrics.Then there is the cost to consider. Modelling done in 2014 suggests that it would cost 1.5 per cent of China’s gross domestic product each year over a 15-year period to grant urban hukou status to China’s migrant workers. This figure would now be much higher. While the economic benefits would probably handsomely offset these costs nationally, the overall process might be somewhat uneven.Who pays is the more pressing question. Despite only collecting 50 per cent of revenue, local governments foot the bill for about 85 per cent of public services. The increasingly precarious nature of local government finances casts severe doubt on the willingness of most localities to expand social expenditure. As only around 10 per cent of people in China (and very few urban migrants) pay income tax, hukou conversion would likely cause local government revenue to suffer even if overall GDP grows. The corollary is that sustainable hukou reform requires deeper and even more politically contested fiscal and taxation reforms.Ideological barriers might also be at play. A variant of the hukou system has been a feature of Chinese governance for thousands of years. Similar systems have been jettisoned elsewhere in East Asia - including in Taiwan - but typically by governments with decidedly more democratic and market-orientated principles.This situation is far from static. With China’s population already falling, the political and economic calculus of hukou reform could conceivably change as demographic decline bites. At least in the short term, whether China can implement deeper hukou reform will serve as a litmus test as to whether Beijing’s commitment to common prosperity is real, or more rhetorical.Henry Storey is a political risk analyst and was formerly an editor at Foreign Brief and Young Australians in International Affairs.

(Illustration: SCMP/Henry Wong)Economists say alternative high-frequency data points – from subway ridership to commodity prices – suggest parts of China’s economy are functioning wellEconomic downturn seen shrinking nation’s middle class, but while some say China may not be in a crisis, its economy is ""not out of the woods, yet"" South China Morning Post South China Morning Post 15 Sep 2023 10:27AM (Updated: 15 Sep 2023 10:35AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn As the hits kept coming, marring China’s battered businesses with fresh bruises over the past month, the discourse surrounding an economic crisis grew louder, and the headlines more prominent.International banks lowered their annual growth forecasts for the world’s second-largest economy; the yuan’s rate against the US dollar kept falling; Beijing suspended the release of dismal youth unemployment figures; and the country’s largest private property developer, Country Garden, warned that it is on the brink of default.Mistrust from the public and overseas investors over Beijing’s official narrative is also growing, even as Beijing has repeatedly vowed to crack down on statistical fraud.But despite the negative sentiment, some economists point to alternative high-frequency data points – from subway ridership to commodity prices – that suggest many parts of China’s economy are functioning well.However, data on the real estate sector – the single biggest contributor to the country’s economy, as it constitutes about 30 per cent of GDP – still points to no meaningful improvement, despite rounds of stimulus policies from Beijing, they said.“The bottom line is that China’s economy is not out of the woods, yet. But it’s not in crisis, either,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.He said growth remains lacklustre due to the drag from property and weak confidence, while high-frequency data suggests that the economy has stabilised at a low level.“Contrary to the prevailing narrative of an imminent recession or even implosion, the Chinese economy is showing more signs of stabilisation rather than further deterioration,” Hu said. “Policy actions over the past month have been in line with the pro-growth pivot at the July Politburo meeting, although policymakers need to act more decisively to pull the housing market out of its ongoing downward spiral.”During the tone-setting meeting, China’s leadership for the first time in years dropped the phrase “houses are for living in, not for speculation”, pointing to a pro-growth shift in the property sector. So far, a slew of relaxing measures – from reducing down payments to scrapping the requirement of “no mortgage records” for identifying “first-home buyers” – have been implemented.The Nanhua industrial product price index, a measure of domestic commodity prices reflecting the demand for industrial and infrastructure investment, grew by 2.5 per cent in August, after rising 6.6 per cent in July. (Source: Nanhua Futures, Wind) “So, the infrastructure investment is probably picking up, and China’s economy – looking from the perspective of commodity demand – is still functioning, it’s more like a soft patch than a hard landing or crash,” Hu said.According to a sentiment index compiled by French investment bank Natixis via posts on Chinese social media and news reports, economic uncertainty has gradually eased since June, when the rapid depreciation of the yuan and stock market fluctuations took a heavy toll on confidence.As for investment sentiment, while remaining low this year, it has still improved compared with earlier this year. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, has improved steadily and moderately since the start of 2023, with similar trends seen in industries such as food, automotive and fashion, Natixis data showed.One of the biggest spotlights has been luxury goods sales. As the world’s second-largest luxury market, China has made a solid comeback since the start of the year, after a blip in 2022 due to stringent zero-COVID lockdowns.According to data from Sandalwood, a global alternative data platform, China’s domestic offline luxury consumption in July increased by 46 per cent compared with the same time last year – when Shanghai was yet to emerge from a citywide lockdown – and also rose by 17 per cent compared with July 2021.The main reason for the robust luxury sales in China this year is that the impact of the pandemic on high-income groups is relatively small – a phenomenon also seen in other countries, said Ying Zhang, a research analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.“The impact of the economic downturn may be more obvious in terms of the shrinking middle class,” she said.RelatedAs China’s property crisis plagues its economy and financial system, is a ‘Lehman moment’ looming?China’s too-big-to-fail property giants the tip of real estate crisis as ‘suppliers are being dragged to death’Apart from a divergence among different income groups, China’s consumption trend this year is polarised among sectors, as service consumption such as concerts, tourism and catering have been better than the sale of goods – which has been more suppressed by worsening income prospects, Zhang said.Sandalwood data showed that the total booking value on two major Chinese travel platforms, Trip.com and Tongcheng Travel, hit a record high in July, thanks to the high demand during the summer holiday.Despite the slightly weakening momentum in August, it still maintained double-digit growth: in the first half of August, bookings on Trip.com increased by 85 per cent by value, year on year, and on Tongcheng Travel they increased by 60 per cent.In some major cities, the subway passenger volume has also been well above pre-pandemic levels in the past few months, though that of the top three metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have yet to fully recover to 2019’s level, according to data compiled by Wind, a Chinese financial data provider.The summer box office data also reached a new historical high this year. According to movie industry data provider Dengta, the box office in China from June to August reached 20.62 billion yuan (US$2.83 billion), compared with the previous record of 17.78 billion yuan achieved in 2019.But such high-frequency data is highly impacted by incidental factors, such as the timing of festivals, said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura.“For the box office, it is highly related to the movies that are on show, so we tend to not jump to any conclusion on the economy just based on the box office,” he said, adding that movie ticket prices are also higher than before the pandemic.And the surge in subway ridership is also related to the growing infrastructure construction in the past years – with new metro lines appearing in Chinese cities, Lu added.Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, said the surge in consumer spending in tourism and entertainment – which are heavily driven by a pent-up need to get out and de-stress after COVID-19 lockdowns – is unlikely to be sustainable.“With low shares and low growth, those segments were never pillars of China’s economy, despite being highly visible,” she said. “Ultimately, those non-essential consumptions are constrained by household income, which is determined by overall economic growth.”For China’s economy, she added: “If you are looking at any place other than housing, you are wasting your time.”Economists from Capital Economics, measuring growth by tracking China’s industrial output, construction activity, traffic volume, property and car sales and electricity consumption, said the economy regained some ground in July, following a contraction in June.“But the big picture is that output has levelled off recently and that the economy could tip into a downward spiral unless policy support is ramped up soon,” they said in a note in late August.“Troubles in the property sector will weigh on confidence among homebuyers and firms for some time. And the risks to exports remain skewed to the downside. The government has responded with some policy support. But it remains too timid and slow-moving.”High-frequency data on the property sector, such as the volume of new home sales in major cities, has remained weak and shown little improvement, despite Beijing’s relaxing measures, economists said.Also read:China's concertgoers splash the cash, but is revenge spending sustainable to rock the economy?‘Hang on to cash’: China’s would-be homebuyers opt to wait out housing downturnChina’s current weak labour market and high youth unemployment suggest cyclical problems, and that the economy is running below potential growthThe deepest property downturn in history certainly reflects changes in long-term fundamentals, to a certain degree, but it was also driven by earlier policy tightening and was aggravated by the pandemic and lockdowns, according to Wang Tao, head of China Economic Research at UBS.“Notwithstanding demographic challenges in the long term, China’s current weak labour market and high youth unemployment suggest cyclical problems, and that the economy is running below potential growth,” she said in a note last week.Wang Tao added that one of the causes of the weaker-than-expected stimulus policies from Beijing is a delayed comprehension of the weakness in China’s economy, mainly due to the uneven recovery reflected in data from different sectors – from the strong domestic travel rebound to the worsening property market – since the second quarter.“What could trigger a larger and more comprehensive policy response from here,” she mulled. “While we do not think the high youth unemployment is an imminent threat to social stability, the worsening of economic data – including on property construction, industrial production, retail sales and exports – could mean more challenges in the overall labour market, in corporate health, and in local government operations.“As such, we expect weak data leading to more policy actions in the coming month.”This article was first published on SCMP.

China has to wean its reliance on the real estate sector given its shifting population trends. (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang) Low Minmin @minminlowCNA Fabian Koh Low Minmin & Fabian Koh 07 Sep 2023 02:13PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SHANGHAI: The financial woes of China’s largest property developers are rippling through the country’s economy, as lawsuits pile up with businesses and workers owed hundreds of billions in payment.China’s ongoing property crisis was triggered by the government’s attempt to reform and de-leverage the sector to prevent a housing bubble.Real estate forms the backbone of the country’s economy, contributing about 30 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), with some 80 per cent of residents' wealth locked in the sector.China Evergrande Group, once the country’s top-selling developer, had filed for bankruptcy last month, while Country Garden – China’s largest real estate firm in terms of sales last year – narrowly avoided what would have been its first default.Experts told CNA the sector is undergoing a long-term transition, as China has to wean its reliance on the sector given its shifting population trends.RIPPLE EFFECTMr Chen Zhi Xiong had founded his own advertising and events planning company in 2019, and was approached by Evergrande for a business collaboration just a year later.The 35-year-old worked with the real estate giant on four projects for three months from October to December 2020, providing billboards, publicity materials, and running promotional events for the firm.“When I asked for payment, the company gave various excuses, saying it takes time to go through the due process (or) that they had no money,” Mr Chen told CNA, adding that payment was delayed for about a year.He later filed a lawsuit, sending the company contract breach letters, notifications and payment reminders, according to court documents seen by CNA. China Evergrande Group, once the country’s top-selling developer, had filed for bankruptcy last month. (REUTERS/Aly Song) “I kept chasing them over the phone as well (but) they kept delaying payment,” he said.Mr Chen used up his own funds for the unpaid projects amounting to US$100,000, and resorted to borrowing from various sources to balance his cash flow and pay suppliers and employees.When Evergrande defaulted on payment, he too was unable to repay his own debt, and was forced to sell his family home and move to a rented apartment half the size of his original place.He also had to downsize his firm by half.When he went down to the Evergrande office physically to demand payment, he ended up being arrested by the police.INTERNAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNAs a group, suppliers to China’s property developers are waiting on at least US$390 billion in payments, according to research firm Gavekal Research. Suppliers to China’s property developers are waiting on at least US$390 billion in payments. (File photo: Reuters/Wong Campion) A former Evergrande employee told CNA that before the firm went into crisis, it had an internal policy for all staff, regardless of whether they were top, middle or entry-level executives.“Employees may be required to buy an apartment from the company, or you have to recommend 50 clients to view a property. Essentially, it is an internal marketing campaign,” said the 27-year-old.The ex-employee bought an apartment from Evergrande, putting in a 20 per cent down payment and taking up a 30-year mortgage.He is currently still servicing his loan at a 5 per cent interest rate, which takes up a third of his monthly salary, even though the apartment he bought has already lost a fifth of its value.“At that time the company couldn’t pay salaries and began to owe about three months of my salary,” he told CNA. China Evergrande Group, once the country’s top-selling developer, had filed for bankruptcy last month. (Photo: Reuters/Aly Song) He added that Evergrande also had a wealth management product, which employees were required to deposit money into.“For example, grassroots employees were required to deposit US$13,780, while middle and senior management executives may need to deposit more. The money can be redeemed after a year, but many employees around us were unable to withdraw it at all after one year was up. There was no money,” he said.While CNA is unable to verify his claims, online databases have shown a long list of court cases filed against Evergrande and its subsidiaries regarding unpaid salaries and breaches of contracts. CHINESE ECONOMY UNRAVELLINGThe reversal of fortunes of China’s top property developers is threatening to unravel the wider economy, as companies have pulled back on hiring with fewer people buying homes.There are 1.5 million fewer jobs in the construction industry now compared to a year ago, according to data from the China Construction Industry Association in June this year.“China had about 100,000 real estate developers before COVID in around 2019. And now the official figures show that more than 5,000 real estate developers have declared bankruptcy, and this process is still going on,” Hang Seng Bank chief economist Wang Dan told CNA. There are 1.5 million fewer jobs in China's construction industry now compared to a year ago. (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo) The Chinese government has rolled out a series of stimulus measures, such as lowering mortgage rates and allowing banks to extend loans to developers.However, suppliers, subcontractors, material dealers and agents are complaining of being left behind, as the system prioritises homebuyers seeking to get their incomplete homes delivered.While government policy has accelerated the contraction of the sector, China’s housing market is also undergoing a long-term transition, according to experts.The country can no longer rely on real estate to fuel growth, as its declining birth rate means that it no longer needs so many houses.“China's fertility rate is at an all-time low. Now it is about 1.3, even lower than Japan, and the ageing is starting to accelerate,” said Mr Wang. China's declining birth rate means that it no longer needs so many houses. (Photo: AFP/Jade Gao) The trend has put pressure on pension payment and wage growth across the country, and there is still “a few more years to go” before China hits the peak of its urbanisation, he added.The key for China is to open more investment channels and guide capital towards consumption and other industries, according to economists.""China used to focus on the construction of new housing. But now that part is basically over. We have to focus more on the service in the real estate sector,” said Mr Wang.“And the services are related to security, or to infrastructure such as the senior centers, kindergartens, or the maintenance of the environment. That investment has to be kept up and we will see a new model in a few years to come.""

(Photo: REUTERS/Florence Lo) 01 Sep 2023 08:19AM (Updated: 04 Sep 2023 11:32AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn (This Sept. 1 story has been corrected to show that state banks cut deposit rates by 10-25 basis points, not 5-25 basis points, in paragraph 20)By Ziyi Tang, Clare Jim and Xie YuBEIJING/HONG KONG : China stepped up measures to boost the country's faltering economy on Friday, with top banks paving the way for further cuts in lending rates and sources saying Beijing plans further action including relaxing home-purchase restrictions.As part of those measures, the authorities also cut the amount of funds institutions need to hold in foreign exchange reserves. The measures cheered investors, and analysts said they should prevent a further downturn in the ailing property sector. China is grappling with a slowdown that has rattled global markets, with the spotlight now firmly focused on troubled developer Country Garden's spiralling debt crisis in a sector that contributes to roughly a quarter of the economy. As pressure mounts, the authorities have rolled out a series of measures to spur the economy and revive the property market, with steps including the easing of some borrowing rules and a cut to the amount of forex banks must hold as reserves.The country is set to take further action including relaxing home-purchase restrictions, four people familiar with the matter said.Regulators including the housing ministry, central bank and financial regulator in coming weeks will implement measures they have been working on over the past few months under State Council guidance, two of the people said.ANZ's senior China economist Betty Wang said several nation-wide property easing measures in the past couple of weeks have exceeded market expectations.""This is the first time since 2021 that China has announced a series of nationwide property easing measures. They will help restore market confidence and prevent the sector from declining further.""COUNTRY GARDEN TESTIn the near term, however, market sentiment will be swayed by the outcome of a crucial test of investor confidence in Country Garden. On Thursday, Country Garden delayed a deadline for creditors to vote on whether to postpone payments for an onshore 3.9 billion yuan ($537 million) private bond until Friday 1400GMT to give bondholders ""sufficient time"" to prepare for the vote.Ahead of the voting result on Friday, some onshore creditors of that private Country Garden bond received interest payments, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.Country Garden declined to comment.Friday's vote is a key hurdle Country Garden faces as it strives to avoid default, with one holder of the developer's dollar bonds saying if the company cannot extend its domestic debt, it will be unable to service external bondholders.""This has been a slow-moving car crash,"" said the bondholder, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, adding that concerns centred around uncertainty over the broader economy and tensions with Washington. ""Everything they do right now is going to have an impact five to 10 years down the line."" Country Garden, China's largest private developer by sales, did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.Stress in the property market has intensified pressure on Beijing to implement supporting measures and fanned concern about the ability of policymakers to arrest a decline in China's broader economic growth.China's new home prices fell for the fourth month in August, according to a private survey on Friday, as the property debt crisis kept confidence at a low ebb despite the string of support measures.DEPOSIT RATES CUT The central bank said on Friday it would cut the foreign exchange reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 200 basis points (bps) to 4 per cent from 6 per cent beginning Sept. 15, a move seen aimed at slowing the pace of yuan declines.The lenders lowering mortgage rates on Friday included Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank Corp and Agricultural Bank of China, which cut their deposit rates by between 10 and 25 basis points, websites from each bank showed. Several midsized banks also announced they will start cutting interest rates on a range of deposits by 10-25 basis points.The measures helped lift confidence in the market and battered property stocks rallied, with China's CSI 300 Real Estate Index ending up 2.4 per cent, while the blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.5 per cent. Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that major state banks would cut deposit rates as they prepare to lower interest rates on existing mortgages soon.Starting from Sept. 25, first-time home buyers with mortgages can apply to their banks for a lower interest rate on their existing loans, China's central bank and financial regulator announced on Thursday.The deposit rate cuts are the third such cuts within a year, with the scale of cuts bigger than previous rounds in June and in September last year.Lower deposit rates will partially offset various pressures on banks' narrowing net interest margins - a key gauge of profitability, said Nicholas Zhu, a banking analyst at Moody's. ""The impact of the deposit rate cut is material, given that close to three-quarters of Chinese banks' liabilities are deposits,"" Zhu said.China's mortgage loans totalled 38.6 trillion yuan ($5.29 trillion) at the end of June, representing 17 per cent of banks' total loan books.Meanwhile, Beijing and Shanghai on Friday announced that they would allow home buyers to enjoy preferential loans for first-home purchases regardless of their previous credit records.With this, all of China's first-tier cities have broadened the definition of first-home mortgages, in a bid to boost buyer sentiment.

Intensifying tremors within China’s property sector have renewed fears about potential spillover effects on the rest of the country’s economy and beyond.The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China on Aug 9, 2023. (File photo: Reuters/Aly Song) Tang See Kit @SeeKitCNA Tang See Kit 31 Aug 2023 07:31PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Default risks are once again flashing in China’s real estate sector.Country Garden, which was the country’s largest property developer by sales volume before this year, is faltering amid record losses, mountains of debt and missed payments to lenders and workers.This comes two years after similar woes at Chinese property titan China Evergrande, which ignited rare protests in the country by aggrieved home buyers and retail investors.For decades, the property sector served as one of the key growth engines of the Chinese economy, accounting for around a quarter of economic output. Intensifying tremors within the sector have inevitably renewed fears about potential spillover effects on the rest of the country’s economy and beyond.Here’s what you need to know:What went wrong?Previously fuelled by economic and population growth, China’s property sector has in recent years fallen on harder times, partly as the domestic economy slowed and housing demand cooled. These challenges deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic which hurt employment and increased income uncertainties.It was also during this time when the Chinese government moved to rein in the massive debt accrued by the industry’s biggest players over the decade-long building boom.In August 2020, Beijing rolled out a “three red lines” policy, a trio of metrics on debt that developers have to meet if they want to borrow more. These essentially tightened conditions for developers to access credit.Unable to borrow and struggling to sell apartments, developers that had been operating far outside the “three red lines” were thrust into a severe cash crunch, resulting in unfinished homes and unpaid suppliers and creditors.Related:Country Garden: How bad is China's property crisis?China’s Evergrande bankruptcy filing an expected part of debt restructuring plan, unlikely to have contagion effect on economy: ObserversA property titan in crisis: What went wrong at China’s Evergrande and what's nextOne of the largest casualties was Evergrande, which was one of China’s largest developers but has turned into the poster child of its sector’s woes after being declared to be in default in late 2021.Following a prolonged debt restructuring, Evergrande – the world’s most indebted real estate company with debts of more than US$300 billion – filed for protection from creditors in a US bankruptcy court on Aug 17.Beyond Evergrande, the sector has seen a series of developer defaults since 2021. Reports have said the number of defaults comes up to companies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales, with most being private property developers.This time, it is another property titan Country Garden in the headlines for financial distress.“This is noteworthy because, in addition to its size, Country Garden was previously viewed as being in relatively good shape compared to most other private developers,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.The private developer was included in a government list of “high quality” developers eligible for funding support from state-owned banks in November last year.“Country Garden’s problems underscore just how bad financial strains in the property sector have become, as well as the failings of existing policy support measures,” Mr Evans-Pritchard wrote in a report dated Aug 16.The developer’s liquidity stress came to light after it missed two dollar bond coupon payments on Aug 6. It has 30 days to pay up to avoid a default.It is also seeking to get creditor support on Aug 31 to add a 40-day grace period for the maturity of a yuan bond due on Sep 2, and extend repayment by three years. The company’s first-half results announced on Aug 30 showed a record net loss of 48.9 billion yuan (US$6.72 billion), up substantially from a 6.7 billion yuan net loss in the second half of 2022 and a 612 million yuan net profit in the first half of 2022.Total liabilities for the January to June period stood at 1.4 trillion yuan.Country Garden said it was “deeply remorseful” for the record losses and warned of default risks if its financial performance continues to deteriorate.Analysts noted that the developer is particularly susceptible to weak demand because it focuses on the lower end of the property market.Shares of Country Garden listed in Hong Kong have plummeted nearly 70 per cent year to date. The counter will be removed from the Hang Seng Index on Sep 4 following the index’s latest quarterly review.Related:Country Garden warns of default risks, 'deeply remorseful' for record lossCountry Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland: AnalysisUnpaid workers, silent sites: China's property woes hit Country GardenHow bad can it get?Experts said that news of yet another top developer teetering on the brink of a default will be a further blow to market confidence and may exacerbate the downturn in China’s property sector.“Default risk concerns will severely weigh on home buyers’ confidence that, in turn, affect sales. This cycle will worsen the liquidity situation of distressed Chinese developers,” said Coface’s chief economist for Asia-Pacific Bernard Aw.While the risk of a default by Country Garden is “rising especially amid weak sales”, Mr Aw reckoned that the contagion impact would be smaller than Evergrande’s partly due to the size of liabilities.Country Garden’s total liabilities of 1.4 trillion yuan are only 59 per cent as big as those at Evergrande.The property sector has also “gone through a wrenching adjustment” and its problems are now widely known versus before, noted Mr Evans-Pritchard.“So, the impact of Country Garden’s woes is unlikely to be as severe as the fallout from Evergrande’s default two years ago,” he said.That said, there are concerns about whether the sector’s worsening woes will hurt the broader Chinese economy, whose post-pandemic bounce is quickly fizzling out.“Although the direct fallout from Country Garden is likely to be more modest than Evergrande, it comes at a more inopportune time when the wider economy is much weaker and the balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions are in worse shape,” said Mr Evans-Pritchard.“As such, a hit to growth that would normally be manageable risks tipping the economy into a vicious cycle between falling output, deleveraging and deflation.”Mr Chen Jingwei, chief investment strategist of Wrise Wealth Management Singapore, said: “A slowdown in (China's property) sector could impact overall growth and significantly affect the adjacent construction industry.“Other sectors like finance, manufacturing, and local governments – which often rely on land sales to finance public projects – may also experience repercussions.”Already, there are signs of troubles emerging elsewhere.Chinese trust firm Zhongrong International Trust, which has sizable real estate exposure, missed payments on dozens of investment products since the end of July. The firm’s second-biggest shareholder Zhongzhi Enterprise Group has said it is facing a liquidity crisis and will restructure debt.“That’s something that will weigh further on sentiment and will keep (economic) activity pretty depressed in the near term,” said Mr Evans-Pritchard.Related:China’s too-big-to-fail property giants the tip of real estate crisis as ‘suppliers are being dragged to death’Commentary: China property giant Country Garden’s woes - the good, the bad and the very uglyShould the rest of the world, including Singapore, be concerned?Despite the risks, experts are generally still expecting China to meet its growth target of around 5 per cent for 2023.More stimulus to support growth could be on the cards, although experts such as Mr Evans-Pritchard reckoned that would unlikely be in the form of a direct bailout of distressed developers with authorities “keen to avoid moral hazard”.Should stimulus steps be taken, these would come in the form of increased fiscal spending to fund big-ticket infrastructure projects, or additional support for consumers and private firms, experts added.Already, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two of China’s biggest cities, have eased mortgage curbs this week.Overall, the outlook ahead for China may be “pretty weak” but it’s “not necessarily catastrophic for the world”, said Capital Economics’ group chief economist Neil Shearing.“We are not describing a complete collapse in the Chinese economy. It’s low but still positive growth, so we don’t think that it will derail economies in the Europe or the United States” he said in an Aug 17 online discussion on the risks surrounding China’s economic outlook.“Unless the outlook for China becomes substantially worse, (it is) primarily a China story at this stage.”Mr Chen from Wrise Wealth Management Singapore also posited that the impact of a default by Country Garden will be “largely contained within the China market”.“This is somewhat alleviated by China’s slower-than-expected reopening and reduced global financial exposure to the real estate sector,” he told CNA.Related:‘She got an abortion, broke up with me’: The human suffering behind China’s property crisisOn that note, experts said that spillover effects into the rest of the Asian economies are not too much of a concern just yet.For Singapore, which has China as one of its top trading partners, any impact from the latter’s housing crisis is “likely to be indirect” if growth in China weakens substantially, said Mr Aw of Coface.Likewise, the impact on investors in Singapore will also be an indirect one.“Substantial downturn in China’s property sector could result in a global sell-off, including in Singapore,” said Mr Chen.For individual stocks, such as Singapore-listed developers with operations in China, these will largely depend on their exposure and resilience, he added.Singapore’s banking sector, for one, does not have a large exposure to the overall Chinese property sector, said Mr Aw, citing information provided by local authorities two years ago in response to the debt crisis surrounding Evergrande.A parliamentary reply in 2021 said that the exposure of Singapore’s banking system to the overall Chinese property sector “is not large”, with direct exposures to China's property sector making up less than 1 per cent of non-bank loans.Areas where investors might want to exercise some caution include Chinese property shares and listed bond funds who have exposure to Chinese property issuers like Country Garden, said Mr Chen.“We anticipate further repayment difficulties in this industry until substantial support and stimulus measures are unveiled by the government,” he said.“As such, it is prudent for investors to wait for more definitive policy actions that can reinstate market and consumer confidence before re-engaging with such trades in China’s property sector.” Source: CNA/sk(rj) Related Topics CNA Explains China Evergrande property real estate Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

(Illustration: SCMP/Lau Ka-kuen)Indebted property developers such as Evergrande and Country Garden owe millions to small companies and their workers, showing how far-reaching the impact has becomeMillions of homebuyers who pre-bought property have little recourse but to wait for a turnaround, and industry insiders say the onus is on Beijing to act South China Morning Post South China Morning Post 31 Aug 2023 10:02AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn If you ask small business owner Bill Ye, the writing was on the wall for China’s embattled property sector long before Country Garden said its net losses in the first half of this year could reach 55 billion yuan (US$7.6 billion).But the ramifications of this month’s revelation, he said, could be devastating to both market confidence and in terms of debt repayments from the nation’s major developers to suppliers like himself who are bleeding cash amid China’s property crisis.For the past two years, the owner of a relatively small piling company says he has been trying to collect more than 200 million yuan owed by the world’s most indebted property developer – China Evergrande Group.All the while, his own unpaid workers, investors and suppliers are angrily clamouring for tens of millions owed to them – showing how the crisis has trickled down and hit the entire industry.“It could get worse. It’s one thing after another,” he told friends, asking for their advice on what he should do.It wasn’t too long ago that times were great. Ye, now in his early forties, started the piling company in southern China in 2010 and was able to capitalise on China’s post-financial-crisis construction boom – when it turned to massive infrastructure investment to lift the economy.Piling is a technique that sets deep foundations for any form of construction work, including buildings.Related:Commentary: China property giant Country Garden’s woes - the good, the bad and the very uglyCountry Garden: How bad is China's property crisis?Country Garden restructuring fears deepen concerns about China property sectorBack then, all of the players – including local governments, developers, suppliers and buyers – engaged in frenetic land purchases, construction and property trading. And for Ye, the future looked especially bright in 2017, when he scored a partnership with property giant Evergrande.But the good times would not last. Also in 2017, President Xi Jinping famously declared that “houses are for living in, not for speculation”. Beijing would go on to support that sentiment by tightening credit rules against property speculation. And eventually, Evergrande was the first domino to fall when it defaulted in late 2021.“A huge number of suppliers for developers, like me, have been deeply trapped by the crisis,” Ye said, lamenting that the vast majority of his wealth has been wiped out in just two years.Hundreds of thousands of victims have been sucked into the Evergrande black hole, which reported 812 billion yuan in combined loss for 2021-22, and nearly 2.39 trillion yuan worth of liabilities as of Jun 30.Unlike local government financing vehicles, which are largely owned by governments at different levels – with their debt owed to state-owned banks and middle-class investors through a variety of wealth-management products – the crisis in the property sector is particularly urgent because it involves so many households nationwide.In early 2022, Evergrande chairman Xu Jiayin released a target of delivering 600,000 homes that year – “equivalent to nearly 50 per cent of its pre-sold housing projects”. But according to the latest update by the firm on Aug 25, Evergrande delivered only about 301,000 homes in 2022.Related:China developer Evergrande posts losses for first half of the yearChina Evergrande loses US$2.4 billion in value as trade resumes after 17 monthsAs China’s property crisis plagues its economy and financial system, is a ‘Lehman moment’ looming?Unlike developed markets where second-hand homes dominate the market and properties are largely sold upon completion, a vast majority of new Chinese properties are sold often before construction starts.Fears have spread that pre-sold homes might not be completed, due to the slow progress. China Business News, a state-backed newspaper in Shanghai, reported that only a third of unfinished pre-sold homes identified in September 2022 had been completed as of May this year.Breaking it down geographically, the proportion of deliveries was 56 per cent in southern China, 40 per cent in the east, 15 per cent in the southwest, and 16 per cent in central China.And with no light seen at the end of the tunnel two years after Evergrande’s debt crisis unfolded, analysts warn that Beijing needs to take immediate actions – or perhaps a different approach entirely – to prevent contagion and spillover fears.“Ensuring the delivery of unfinished property units is [one of] Beijing’s measures to protect consumers, that is homebuyers, to prevent this from turning into a mass social problem,” said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist with ANZ Bank.Beijing has taken some steps to maintain social stability and prevent a banking crisis. In June, the central bank extended 200 billion yuan worth of re-lending quotas to ensure completion of unfinished property units and to allow commercial banks to roll over maturing loans after the Evergrande crisis, extending the policies until the end of next year.Policy changes are also meant to increase bank loans. And special teams have been dispatched by Beijing and local authorities to oversee the process.This approach is distinctly different from that seen in the US, which chose in 2008 to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of the largest mortgage loan providers, by injecting funding and market-oriented restructuring.“The (Chinese) government needs to follow laws and regulations and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to measure the actual impact on jobs and the national economy,” Yeung said.The current downturn in China’s real estate sector is caused by government policies, not by the real estate sector itself, said Yao Yang, a Chinese economist and dean of Peking University’s National School of Development, while speaking at a public forum in Shenzhen last week.He called on authorities to abandon restrictive measures on real estate credit. Secondly, bankruptcy proceedings and reorganisations should be carried out for developers with capital-outflow problems. (Image: SCMP) “Now the debts are hanging in the air. Some big companies are too big to fail, but it’s leading to their suppliers being dragged to death.” Yao was quoted as saying.Thirdly, the authorities must resolutely stop intervening in the market’s trades and falling home prices, Yao added.In a research report on Thursday (Aug 31), Gavekal Dragonomics said: “In the financial sector, moral-hazard constraints explain why regulators have not bailed out struggling developers, and will probably not fully compensate investor losses on high-risk investment products, following years of warnings.”Fitch Rating says the outlook for Chinese developers is “deteriorating”, citing a lack of improvement in private developers’ funding access and weak homebuyer sentiment. However, it says the outlook for many state-owned developers is stable.“Sales of most distressed developers are unlikely to stabilise in the next few years, while pressure on overall sales may persist without an aggressive policy response,” analysts Lan Wang and Duncan Innes-Ker wrote in a credit brief last week.Peter Berezin, a global investment strategist at BCA Research in Canada, warned that the Chinese housing market looks even worse than Japan’s market in the early 1990s.“In terms of leverage associated with the property developers, China looks worse. In terms of the prospect of a demographic decline, China looks abysmal,” he said. “And so, the question then is what does China do to fill that hole in spending that the housing market occupied? It was the same question that Japan faced in the early 1990s, and they didn’t have a good answer.”In the first seven months after China ended its strict COVID-19 restriction, Country Garden’s sales fell by 35 per cent, year on year, and the operating cash flow dried up.Behind the private giants are dozens or even hundreds of smaller private firms that have also been dragged into the debt crisis. But local authorities cannot provide additional funding because of their sluggish fiscal revenue seen during the pandemic.“It is actually even more difficult for us to get the arrears,” said Raymond Zheng, another supplier, “because many of the contracts signed with Evergrande are overturned and disapproved by local governments.”Despite Beijing having vowed to ensure timely payments to small and private firms, those payments owed by Evergrande have been made exceptions, after the government stepped in to solve its crisis.Zheng, who is also in the piling business, has similarly seen his fortune plunge amid the property crisis.To make matters worse, his credit standing took a hit because he defaulted on payments to third parties, meaning he is now restricted from borrowing money, using a credit card or even buying an air ticket, according to China’s social credit system.“I used to be a successful, private entrepreneur,” Zheng said. “But now I’m making preparations for the worst – going bankrupt personally and corporately.”Meanwhile, as many homebuyers remain anxious about the delivery of their pre-bought properties, Beijing’s actions in ensuring prompt delivery times seem to be paying off.In the first half of this year, the top-50 Chinese developers completed and delivered more than 2.02 million pre-sold homes, state media reported last month.Country Garden said that the firm delivered 700,000 pre-sold housing units last year and planned to complete another 700,000 units this year. It delivered 278,000 units in the first half of the year, according to its statement in July.But the two piling entrepreneurs, Zheng and Ye, expressed doubts that the newly introduced policies will have a practical effect, and they were concerned that enforcement and governance are fraught with arbitrariness on the ground.“So, how can the authorities bring certainty to investors and the market,” Ye asked.They fear that, if the Country Garden crisis deepens, it could strike a big blow to market confidence and debt chains among the country’s developers and their suppliers.“There is a serious surplus of houses, especially in fourth- and fifth-tier cities. Besides, everything is unknowable ahead, like how much property prices will fall, in which direction policies will change, and whether the business environment for private companies will continue to deteriorate,” Ye said.China Real Estate News, a newspaper afflicted with the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, ran an op-ed piece on Aug 20 saying that local stimulus measures had failed to yield obvious results because core issues concerning supply and demand had not been addressed.“The financing environment of private developers has not substantially improved. A large number of those who already reported defaults are now still struggling, while many others are also gradually slipping to the edge of risk due to the market deterioration,” it warned.Meanwhile, the state-run publication warned that market expectations are unstable – with household consumption weakening while restrictions in purchases, loans, and prices in some cities remain strict.“The policy support should start with ensuring the cash flow of developers and their deliveries of pre-sold units; the relaxation of administrative interventions; and the lowering of home-buying costs, including down payments, taxes and sales prices,” it added.This article was first published on SCMP.

(File photo: Reuters/Alex Lee) 30 Aug 2023 10:12AM (Updated: 31 Aug 2023 09:56PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING: Two of China's biggest cities eased mortgage curbs and the country's top banks flagged mounting risks from the deepening property sector turmoil on Wednesday (Aug 30), as Beijing ramps up efforts to shore up the sputtering economy.Guangzhou, China's fifth biggest city, and the tech hub of Shenzhen said that mortgage curbs would be eased, allowing home buyers to enjoy preferential loans for first-home purchases regardless of their previous credit record.The moves comes after Chinese authorities called on cities to broaden the definition of first-home mortgage as part of a string of other measures to revive the troubled property market, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the economy.In other support measures, some Chinese state-owned banks are also expected to lower interest rates on existing mortgages, three sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, in the first such cut since the global financial crisis.Beijing hopes the reduction in mortgage payments will help revive consumer demand for property.Those measures are, however, adding to concerns about the impact on Chinese banks.Two of China's biggest banks - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) and Bank of China (BoC) - reported sluggish profit growth and shrinking profit margins for the first half.In a sign of mounting challenges for lenders from the deepening property crisis, BoC's Chief Risk Officer Liu Jiandong said the bank's mortgage asset quality was facing pressure, but there was no material deterioration.China's mortgage loans totalled 38.6 trillion yuan (US$5.29 trillion) at the end of June, representing 17 per cent of banks' total loan books.The Chinese property sector has lurched from one crisis to another since 2021, and contagion fears deepened this month after liquidity stress in leading developer Country Garden became public.Just how cash-strapped Country Garden is will be the focus when China's largest private property developer reports its first-half results on Wednesday.SUPPORT MEASURESThe expected reduction in existing mortgage rates is one of several support measures Beijing has announced in recent weeks, as concerns mount about the health of the world's second-largest economy.Some analysts and home buyers were not convinced about how effective the steps would be in reviving buyer demand, as consumer confidence has been badly hit by economic woes that pushed the youth unemployment rate to a record high in June.Property agents said there were few people shopping in the secondary market, and commercial mortgage rates are still much higher than the rates offered by the housing provident fund, a savings program by governments for housing purchases.Homeowner Jackson Wang said he is going to move his mortgage with a top Chinese bank to the provident housing fund, which would lower his interest rate to 3.2 per cent from the current 4.8 per cent. He pays more than 5,000 yuan per month for a flat in the eastern city of Linyi.""I have already bought a home at a high price and been paying a high mortgage, so I'm hoping for a rate cut,"" Wang, 38, said.""I'm too disappointed in China real estate. I will not be attracted by the sector again unless home prices are reduced, a lot.""Raymond Cheng, Hong Kong-based head of China research at CGS-CIMB Securities Ltd, said the easing in mortgage rules came too late and any boost to home sales may not be significant given very weak home buyer sentiment.""The impact could be much bigger on developers' sales if regulators implemented the policy six to nine months ago,"" he said.BANKS' MARGINThe mortgage rate cuts will add to margin pressure on banks already battling headwinds such as lower lending rates, pressure from the government to prop up the economy, as well as bad debts related to developers and local government financing vehicles.BoC said that some local government financing vehicles (LGFV) - which play a key role in the country's infrastructure development - have defaulted, but the business is operating steadily.""For Bank of China the current overall business with local government financing platforms remains stable, and the total amount of credit granted is relatively moderate among peers,"" BoC's Liu said.""Therefore, the asset quality has declined slightly compared with the beginning of the year but it is still under control.""Big state-owned banks have recently been rolling over loans to LGFVs - which have an estimated US$9.1 trillion in debt - or lent more to them.Vivian Xue, director of APAC Financial Institution at Fitch Ratings, said revenue pressure on the banking sector was expected to persist into 2024, due to narrowing margins and tepid retail loan demand.To soften the effect, the sources told Reuters that major state banks would also lower interest rates on some fixed-term deposits, and the quantum of cuts would range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo 28 Aug 2023 02:12PM (Updated: 28 Aug 2023 02:21PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING: China's new home prices will likely show no growth this year, according to a Reuters poll, highlighting the intense pressure in the crisis-hit property sector that has put a choke-hold on the economy and left policymakers in a scramble to restore confidence.The expected 0 per cent year-on-year growth in home prices compared with a 1.4 per cent gain tipped in the previous forecast in May, a Reuters poll of 12 economists conducted from Aug 16 to Aug 25 showed.Confidence in the real estate sector, which accounts for a quarter of China's economy, suffered last year after many homebuyers threatened to stop repaying mortgages because developers couldn't build pre-sold housing projects due to strapped liquidity and strict COVID-19 restrictions.""The slowdown of China's economic recovery and conservative consumption by residents shows that property market participants' confidence has not yet recovered,"" said Wang Xingping, senior analyst at Fitch Bohua.Authorities have introduced several measures over the past year to prop up the sector, including smaller down payments, allowing bigger mortgages and cuts in mortgage rates. However, confidence remains low, partly due to persistent liquidity problems among property developers as well as a broader slowdown in the economy.Property investment this year is expected to fall 7.7 per cent year-on-year, much faster than the 4.2 per cent drop forecast in the May poll, while home sales measured by floor area are expected to decline 5.0 per cent in annual terms in 2023 from a gain of 2.7 per cent in the previous poll.The world's second-biggest economy has seen a rapid loss in momentum since the second quarter following the initial post-COVID rebound, dragged down by weak demand at home and abroad, rising unemployment and property sector woes.""It is estimated that every one percentage point decline in property investment may drag down the GDP growth rate by 0.1 percentage points,"" said analyst Ma Hong at Zhixin Investment Research Institute.China observers are sceptical that the property sector could turn a corner in the near term despite Beijing's support measures.Three Chinese ministries issued detailed rules on Friday allowing local governments to scrap the rule of ""no mortgage record"" for determining the status of ""first-home buyers"".The biggest cities are expected to relax property curbs in some suburbs, ""but it is hardly going to save the whole real estate sector from a downward spiral,"" said Gao Yuhong, analyst at CSCI Pengyuan Credit Rating Limited.Seven of 12 economists see an improvement in purchasing affordability for first-time homebuyers over the coming year.However, ANZ's economist Xing Zhaopeng said youth employment will be a big issue to first-home purchasing.The government has suspended publishing data on youth unemployment, which has hit record highs in what analysts say is partly a symptom of regulatory crackdowns on big employers in real estate and other industries.

""In some popular cities, housing demand still exceeds supply. Once speculation on house prices resumes, China may go back to the old path of the over-reliance on the real estate sector, which will have adverse impacts on economic and social development.""In July's key policy meeting, top leaders said China will adjust and optimise property policies in a timely manner, in response to profound changes in the supply and demand relationship in the property market.The rising risk of default among some developers and faltering economic recovery has led investors to expect more and bigger stimulus to revive the housing market.But they were disappointed when the People's Bank of China (PBOC) held the five-year loan prime rate steady on Monday. The five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages, and some analysts said the central bank may be trying to protect lenders' margins.Property-related loans accounts for 40 per cent of banks' lending, and property ownership accounts for 60 per cent of Chinese household wealth, the Economic Daily said.Goldman Sachs analysts estimate the housing sector's contribution to GDP growth is a drag of 1.5 per centage points this year and likely to remain at least slightly negative for the foreseeable future, according to a note on Wednesday.

(Illustration: Davies Christian Surya)China Evergrande Group reported losses of 812 billion yuan (US$112 billion) for 2021 and 2022, while fellow property developer Country Garden is on the verge of a bond defaultA so-called ""Lehman moment"" – where one company’s problems become everyone’s problems – is seen as unlikely, but mounting problems are set to test Beijing South China Morning Post South China Morning Post 23 Aug 2023 10:14AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Two years after the bond default by one of China’s biggest real estate developers created the first shock waves, Beijing’s promise that everything is under control is becoming increasingly harder to sell to investors.Fears jumped further this summer as ailing developer China Evergrande Group then reported a combined loss of 812 billion yuan (US$112 billion) for 2021 and 2022 – a figure higher than its total earnings since it was established in 1996.Its bankruptcy protection application filed in a US court last week also grabbed significant attention on Chinese social media.The Chapter 15 petition, which referenced restructuring proceedings being carried out in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands, also raises a multitude of questions for Beijing.How can it comfort hundreds of thousands of people who are making mortgage payments for homes that have not been delivered?How can it appease worried investors who are shunning Chinese equities?How can it turn around a growing number of bearish views about China’s financial system and its economic growth?Global investors, Chinese homebuyers and economists are now holding their breath to see which domino will be the next to fall, and what tools Beijing can use to prevent its own so-called ""Lehman moment"" – a phrase drawn from the late 2008 bankruptcy of global investment bank Lehman Brothers to describe the trigger of a systemic risk outbreak.The debt time bomb is also now ticking as Country Garden, one of China’s top five developers, is on the verge of a bond default after estimating losses ranging between 45 billion yuan and 55 billion yuan for the first half of 2023.And dozens of private developers in China could also follow suit.“I don’t think there’ll be a Lehman moment,” said George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre.“In a state banking system, the authorities can move liabilities around the financial system and use ‘extend and pretend’ accounting to ensure that major banks don’t fail and that smaller ones can be made good or merged as necessary.”However, multiple failures with high connectivity will test Beijing’s capacity to prevent contagion, he warned.“If anyone is expecting a single sudden event to cause a near collapse of the banking sector then they don’t understand how the system is set up and structured,” said Fraser Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundations of China’s Extraordinary Rise.China’s banking system, which is estimated to have large exposure to the property sector, is largely controlled by state-owned players such as the ""Big Four"" banks, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China.However, “pressures play out in a different way”, added Howie.Property is the most prominent risk in China, in addition to local debt and small bank stress, because it is deeply integrated into the national economy, affecting anyone from iron ore miners to steel and cement producers, home decoration businesses, domestic appliance makers, construction workers and millions of homebuyers.It is also deemed systemically important worldwide.Related:Country Garden restructuring fears deepen concerns about China property sectorThe US subprime loan crisis 17 years ago – which involved offering mortgages to prospective borrowers with impaired credit records – was amplified by complicated financial packaging and eventually evolved into a global financial crisis.Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Washington bailed out the likes of AIG and Goldman Sachs, while the British government also nationalised Northern Rock Bank.The bursting of the property bubble also worsened the Japanese crisis in the 1990s and led to its so-called lost decades of stagnation.“One challenge in the specific Chinese situation is that very high growth can hide a multitude of problems, which then gets exposed when growth slows,” said Jon Danielsson, director of the systemic risk centre at the London School of Economics.“Just like when the level of water in a lake falls, we see a lot of things we didn’t know existed.”The Chinese translation of Danielsson’s book, The Illusion of Control: Why Financial Crises Happen, and What We Can (and Can’t) Do About It, recently attracted attention after it was translated by China’s vice-minister of finance, Liao Min.Danielsson particularly warned about the “unknown-unknown risk”, which is beyond the capability of a government to know and to deal with.“The lesson is that the trigger for a crisis episode can come out of nowhere, just like the (US) subprime (crisis), and there is no way for a government authority to be aware of all of them,” he said.“What matters is how it reacts to the crisis.“(However,) when the policymakers and government react at the last moment without having planned or thought through all the angles beforehand, often because they hope things will get better, is the scenario that is particularly costly.”China’s developers have enjoyed a golden period since former premier Zhu Rongji initiated home privatisation in 1998 as part of the plan to boost domestic demand.It turned into a pillar industry which contributed to more than a quarter of the national growth in its heyday in 2010s.Rising home prices also drew increased speculation, forcing Beijing to install a variety of purchase, sales, mortgage and credit restrictions.According to a survey by the People’s Bank of China in early 2020, property accounted for 59.1 per cent of household wealth and three-quarters of their household liabilities.China’s property crisis initially started in early 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic halted the cash flows of major developers.Beijing responded by outlining its three red lines to define thresholds on borrowings in August 2020.They were originally rolled out under the thought that the property sector is China’s largest “grey rhino” risk and answered President Xi Jinping’s warning that “houses are for living in, not for speculation”.At the end of June, outstanding bank loans to the property sector grew by 0.5 per cent from a year earlier to 53.37 trillion yuan, government data showed.It includes 13.1 trillion yuan for property developers and around 38 trillion yuan of mortgage loans.Related:China's new home prices fall for first time this year, dimming economic outlookChina's property sector set to be persistently weak for years: Goldman According to calculations by 132 domestically listed developers by Chinese data provider Wind, combined sales revenue fell by 8.3 per cent last year – the first since 2005 – while their debt ratio was 78.99 per cent in 2022, only slightly lower than 79.03 per cent in 2019.The data, though, did not include Evergrande and other Hong Kong-listed firms.Their return on equities registered the first decline on record of 3.78 per cent, and the domestically listed developers reported a combined loss of 66 billion yuan – also the first loss since the data became available.They also had a new cash outflow of 285.6 billion yuan from their fundraising activities – a sign that the sector is struggling to seek external funding from banks, investments or bonds.But the problems have not significantly spilled over into the financial system.The non-performing loan ratio in the property sector was 1.4 per cent when it was last released in 2020, the highest since 2010 but lower than 9.2 per cent in 2005 and 3.35 per cent in 2008, according to data provided by the National Financial Regulatory Administration.China, though, has not updated the non-performing loan ratio for the property sector since 2020.But the overall non-performing loan ratio for commercial banks was just 1.62 per cent by the end of June, lower than 1.81 per cent four years ago.“State ownership provides Chinese banks with a degree of protection against problems elsewhere in the financial system and there are currently few signs of any strains in the interbank market,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, chief China economist at Capital Economics.“But even if a wider financial crisis is avoided, shadow bank failures are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for subprime borrowers.”Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, one of the country’s largest private wealth managers, have reportedly failed to repay some maturing products under more than 1 trillion yuan of assets that the company manages.In late July, Zhongzhi reportedly hired professional services firm KPMG to conduct an audit of its balance sheet.“The next few weeks are crucial, as the clock is ticking for some of the major developers,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital, who attributed the ongoing property woes to a downward spiral between confidence and sales.“Now the game changer is a package of policy measures, which is strong enough to turn around the market expectation and pull the housing market out of the current downward spiral.”The one-way bet on property is now waning as the myth that China’s property prices will keep rising has been broken.The value of property sales in the first seven months of the year fell by 1.5 per cent to 7.05 trillion yuan, while the floor space sold dropped by 6.5 per cent from a year earlier to 665.6 million square metres, government data showed.After China’s Politburo, headed by President Xi, removed the sentence that “houses are for living in, not for speculation” in July, markets have been expecting further policy relaxation.In June, the central bank extended 200 billion yuan of relending quotas to ensure completion of unfinished property units and allow commercial banks to roll over maturing loans after the Evergrande crisis, extending the policies until the end of next year.Different from Western bailouts, Beijing tends to allow state-owned players and banks to help absorb troubled companies.In the case of Evergrande, authorities dispatched special teams to the company to ensure the delivery of property units, the management of debt repayment and to ensure overall social stability.In a de-risking conference on Friday, China’s central bank, as well as its banking and securities regulators, pledged to optimise credit policies and enrich tools to defuse local debt risk.“We must firmly defend the bottom line of preventing systemic risk,” they said.Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio said that China is better positioned than many other countries because debts are largely in yuan and they are largely owed to domestic citizens and institutions.“There is an obvious need for a big debt restructuring of the sort that Zhu Rongji engineered in the late 1990s, just much bigger,” he said on Friday, referring to Zhu’s move to set up four national asset management companies to split bad loans from state banks.The legendary fund manager’s “beautiful deleveraging” theory, which balances deflationary defaults and restructurings with debt monetisation to spread out the burden, has attracted significant attention from high-ranking Chinese officials in the past five years.“If the government has tools to change the dire economic situation then they either aren’t using them or they are not working,” added Howie.“The best scenario is muddling through where the government manages a slew of chronic economic problems and hopes they don’t become acute ones which could have significant shocks or cause panic, i.e. allowing localised bank failures but ensuring the state banks in big cities don’t see [bank] runs.”A likely outcome, according to Magnus, is that the real estate waves are likely to last a long time and the only viable solution is by allocating the costs of the crisis to someone – government, banks or homebuyers.“In China’s case, this might mean the resocialisation of much of the housing sector,” he said.“I don’t think anyone should think there’s a free lunch out there or that this won’t be a painful experience.”This article was first published on SCMP.

We are all worried,"" said a labourer surnamed Wang, 50, who said he had stopped work at the Yunhe Shangyuan site last week.The sprawling complex is one of two projects Reuters visited on Friday (Aug 18) in Tianjin, a port city of 14 million people about 135km southeast of Beijing. Both sites are run by Country Garden, China's largest developer by sales volume before this year, now mired in a debt crisis threatening to spill over to the wider economy.Construction had partially or fully stopped at both sites - the larger one with a few rows of unfinished five-storey apartment blocks and the other with lifeless cranes and thick green scaffolding hanging over skeletal high-rises. Workers at dorms on the sites complained of months without pay.""I'm under a lot of pressure,"" said a worker at the Yunhe Shangyuan site surnamed Wei, also in his 50s, who added that he had only received a one-off living stipend of 4,500 yuan (US$618) so far this year.""I have a wife and kid who's about to return to school, as well as elderly parents ... Workers can't live on this.""Once considered one of the more financially sound developers, Country Garden is now a bellwether of how the cycle has turned for developers.Its financial woes have added to the debt crisis in China's real estate sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the world's second-largest economy, currently losing steam amid a housing slump and weak consumer spending.A representative of Country Garden's Yunhe Shangyuan project said in a WeChat statement its ""registered employees"" were all being paid.At the Yunjing Huating site, the government in June ordered construction to be suspended to fix management problems, a project representative told Reuters in a separate statement. It has since passed inspection and work is expected to resume next week, the person said, adding the suspension would have no impact on the targeted completion date of October 2024.Some workers are not employed directly by the developer, the Yunjing Huating representative said, but by its contractor, which ""has promised to pay the workers' wages by the end of this month"".The project contractor, Shenyang Tengyue Construction, did not pick up calls from Reuters or respond to emails seeking comment.The housing ministry did not comment on Reuters queries about halting of construction in the property sector in general or Country Garden in particular.Related:Commentary: China property giant Country Garden’s woes - the good, the bad and the very ugly‘Deserted ghost town’: Johor Country Garden condo residents concerned over unfinished projects amid China developer’s debt crisisUNFINISHED HOMESCountry Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura. It has not publicly acknowledged whether any of its projects have halted construction due to financial constraints.In an exchange filing on Aug 10, Country Garden said it would ""spare no effort to ensure delivery"" of apartments and that it would ""ensure the operation of projects nationwide"" to fulfil its commitment to home buyers.Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins and by promising ""five-star living"" in less popular, smaller cities.Tianjin has about a dozen Country Garden projects, with the majority finished and delivered, said Gao Fei, investment advisory manager at the Tianjin branch of Centaline Property Agency.Gao said halted construction projects were ""relatively rare"" in the city, representing about a dozen out of 300 sites for sale, but ""there are indeed projects whose development progress has slowed down"".""In China, it is a common phenomenon because now all developers control the rhythm of construction based on the sales rate ... so once sales slow down, so will construction,"" Gao told Reuters.Confidence in the sector took a big hit last year after many Chinese homebuyers threatened to stop repaying mortgages, as developers stopped building pre-sold housing projects due to strapped liquidity and strict COVID-19 restrictions.China's real estate market slightly rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 but transaction volumes have since declined, with the majority of city housing markets remaining in a ""depressed"" state, said Gao.""We have seen that many home buyers are affected by a lack of income, and their home buying choices and what they can afford have been impacted in turn.""

(Photo: CNA/Fadza Ishak)News of Country Garden’s debt crisis in China has sparked fears among residents living in the developer’s subsidiary projects in JohorMany are worried that unfinished projects will be abandoned and property prices will fall furtherIndustry experts say residents concerns are valid and Country Garden Malaysia should publicly clarify if projects will proceed as planned Amir Yusof @AmirYusofCNA Amir Yusof 23 Aug 2023 06:00AM (Updated: 30 Aug 2023 04:25PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn JOHOR BAHRU: A bustling, futuristic metropolis with spacecraft-shaped towers draped in greenery is what the area around the Forest City residential project in Johor Bahru should look like today.But it remains a mirage for Singaporean Chee Pei Lin, four years after moving into her two-bedroom apartment there that she paid RM700,000 (S$204,779) for in 2019. Lured by the lower property price compared to Singapore's and prospects of using the 635 square feet apartment as a retirement home, Ms Chee tells CNA she now feels underwhelmed and disappointed by the slow pace of the development around her apartment block at Ataraxia Park and the surrounding city centre. “All around the town, there are pockets of space which are barren and underutilised. But if you look at the 3D model on show at the sales gallery, there are supposed to be more residential towers and other amenities like yachts and shopping complexes,” says the 48-year-old. This land adjacent to the Forest City sales gallery is left barren, with no construction taking place yet. (Photo: CNA/Amir Yusof) Ms Chee, who works in finance, adds that the recent news of the project developer’s parent company Country Garden in China edging towards financial default exacerbates her concerns.Specifically, she fears that construction for the remainder of the Forest City development may not be completed and that the area she lives in will continue to be a “deserted ghost town”. “The reports are very worrying. I think it raises a lot of questions (on) whether the developer in Malaysia also has cash flow problems, and if they will be able to finish what they planned to do?” she adds.Property experts in Johor CNA spoke to concur that these concerns are valid, especially given recent steps taken by Country Garden to divest its property ventures in other countries. COUNTRY GARDEN’S DEBT CRISIS COULD IMPACT PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA, MALAYSIA The debt crisis at Country Garden in China has made global headlines as the firm had been the country’s largest developer by sales value before 2023. Last week, it suspended trading in nearly a dozen onshore bonds, paving the way for debt negotiations and a possible restructuring, as its share price plummeted. The company now has a 30-day grace period reportedly till early September to pay up its debts before it is considered to be in default.Related:Unpaid workers, silent sites: China's property woes hit Country GardenCommentary: China property giant Country Garden’s woes - the good, the bad and the very uglyThe firm’s business and construction projects are mainly concentrated in cities across mainland China, but it has subsidiary companies in Malaysia which also oversee three developments in the southern state of Johor.This includes the company’s flagship US$100 billion (S$135 billion) mega project Forest City in Gelang Patah and another coastal development, Danga Bay, near Johor Bahru which has a gross development value of US$18 billion. The third project - Central Park - is still under construction and the entire masterplan of the project is set to be completed from 2024. It is set to be valued at RM4.6 billion (US$990 million).A planned development across four separated pieces of reclaimed land near the Tuas Second Link bridge, Forest City encompasses condominium complexes, villas, a hotel, golf courses as well as various other amenities such as malls and schools. As of August 2023, only 15% of Forest City's master plan have been developed fully. (Photo: CNA/Amir Yusof) According to checks on property websites online, prices of houses in Forest City range from around RM400,000 to RM4.8 million. Danga Bay meanwhile features six different condominium complexes within its 0.23 sq km of coastal reclaimed land. File photo of Beletime mall in the Country Garden Danga Bay development in Johor Bahru. (Photo: CNA/Fadza Ishak) The project offers one to four-bedroom condominium units, with prices currently valued at between RM300,000 and RM1.3 million. The Central Park project also offers apartment units of between one to four-room houses. In addition, it also has two-storey terrace units valued at between RM280,000 to RM1.1 million. CNA spoke to 10 residents from the two developments in Johor - Forest City and Danga Bay - who expressed that they are concerned that the parent company’s financial woes will have a spillover effect on the completion of projects in Malaysia. They worry that this may have an indirect impact on property value as well as their living environment, looking at Country Garden’s moves over its projects elsewhere.According to news reports in Australia, the beleaguered China company is putting up for sale a 150-hectare undeveloped portion of its Windermere estate with an asking price of A$250 million (S$218 million). A report by Financial Review also quoted the developer as saying that it plans to “divest” its last remaining project in Australia - the A$2 billion Wilton Greens Estate in Sydney.Mr Samuel Tan, the executive director of KGV International Property Consultants in Johor, tells CNA that it is “quite inevitable” that debt issues by Country Garden China will also trigger negative sentiments among current residents and prospective buyers in Malaysia. “It is a valid concern by some of these residents that Country Garden in Malaysia might also default and this will trigger cash flow problems that will impact the completion of the projects,” says Mr Tan. “If demand is slow, they will stop launching any new products. This is a practical and pragmatic stance by any developer,” he adds. FOREST CITY ONLY 15% COMPLETED; RESIDENTS FEAR VALUE DEPRECIATION In a press statement on Aug 2 - just 12 days before news broke that Country Garden in China missed bond payments and its shares sank - Country Garden Malaysia said the firm was committed to proceeding with its plan to develop Forest City, in line with the existing master plan until 2025. The statement quoted the firm’s regional deputy president Syarul Izam Sarifudin as saying that development at Forest City had been hampered by “unforeseen factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow global economy”.Mr Syarul Izam Sarifudin also said that the company is “always prepared to review and to re-evaluate Forest City's development plans after 2025” if there is a need to do so. Construction of the Forest City project began in 2015, with an aim to develop four artificial islands covering a total of 20 sq km. Some parts of the Forest City project have not been developed, as seen on this 3D model in the development's sales gallery. (Photo: CNA/Amir Yusof) Since then, construction for half of one artificial island - equivalent to 15 per cent of the total area of the Forest City project - has been completed. According to the developer, a total of 28,000 residential units have been completed and to date, around 9,000 residents live in Forest City.Forest City has also been infamously reported by various media outlets as a ghost town - in reference to how the area is largely deserted, with a large number of residential units remaining unoccupied. When CNA visited Forest City recently, the housing estates seemed quiet and mostly unoccupied. Only half out of four artificial islands of the Forest City development project have been developed. (Photo: CNA/Amir Yusof) While the properties appeared well maintained by staff clad in Forest City uniforms, there was barely any construction work ongoing on land reserved for development. Singaporean Ms Chee, who lives in Ataraxia Park, tells CNA that she feels it will be “extremely unlikely” that Forest City’s construction will be eventually completed. “What I’m concerned about is the impact on my property’s value. I bought the unit at around RM700,000 but now they are worth only (around) RM400,000,” adds Ms Chee, who bought the apartment partly for investment. “I fear that with this news of potential default, the Malaysian developer will cease construction of the remainder of the project and we will see the value drop even more in the coming months.” Another property owner Hong Li Wei, who owns a three-bedroom apartment at Starview Bay in Forest City, tells CNA that the recent financial woes will likely hit his rental rate. The Malaysian citizen bought the 1,130 sq ft property at around RM1 million in May 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Selangor-based engineer rented out his unit for RM2,000 a month, but with the lack of progress in construction of amenities near his estate, he fears he can no longer convince tenants to continue paying the same amount. “The market rate for units of this size has dropped to around RM900 a month because the amenities around Forest City have not been built as promised. There are no major grocery stores or cineplexes in the estate,” says Mr Hong. “When I read that Country Garden is having financial issues, I am afraid the rent may fall more and my investment would not be worth it anymore,” he adds. Mr Tan of KGV International Property Consultants, told CNA that overall negative sentiment at the Country Garden prices might drive prices and rental rates further down - especially for property owned.He noted that the prices of apartment units in Danga Bay, for instance, have dropped 50-60 per cent since it was launched already. “If the fear persists, there will be auctions of homes and prices will continue to go down,” says Mr Tan. DANGA BAY RESIDENTS FEAR THEY WON’T RECEIVE STRATA TITLE The incompleteness of the development has also triggered a health hazard, according to residents at another Country Garden project, Danga Bay. The entire development has been completely built, except for a single residential block - block 18 - at the King’s Bay section. In minutes of a recent resident’s committee meeting seen by CNA, a representative from the developer Country Garden reportedly said that the company “has the flexibility to build or not to build the provisional block 18” and that “it would be beneficial to the (resident’s) committee if block 18 were not built”, citing less crowd. The area on the top left side shows the present state of paused construction for block 18 at King's Bay estate. (Photo courtesy of resident) The foundation for block 18 has been constructed, but it remains an eyesore, and breeding ground for mosquitoes, according to residents CNA spoke to. A Singaporean owner in the King’s Bay section of the development - who wanted to be identified only as Mr Alvin - tells CNA that puddles of water have formed at the concrete area, and he fears this will facilitate mosquito breeding and lead to the spread of dengue in the estate. “We have had to tell (the condo management committee) - please clear the water. The resources needed to maintain the area are covered by the maintenance fee we pay so we feel that the burden to maintain this unfinished construction area is unfairly placed on the residents,” says Mr Alvin. Another King’s Bay resident who wanted to be known as Mr Morris, a foreign citizen who bought his unit in 2013, told CNA that the unfinished block 18 also includes a “sky garden area” which is part of the common facilities shared by residents in the estate. “The construction for the Sky Garden should have been completed before the handing over of the units to us as pursuant to the sales and purchase agreement, but it was not done,” he adds. Some residents across the different estates in Danga Bay have also expressed concern that they would not receive their strata titles, which is proof of legal ownership of their property. Mr Alvin, who moved into his unit in 2018, told CNA the process to obtain his strata title is ongoing due to “slow” administrative process by the developer as well as local government agencies. He fears that this process will not be completed given that the developer may be impacted by Country Garden’s financial issues in China. Singaporean Mr Mukhzin Hamid has also not received his strata title, despite having completed the purchase of his seaview three-bedroom apartment unit in 2015. He fears a scenario that his apartment may be seized by the government or liquidators.“It seems unreal that this can happen to us. We have already paid hundreds of thousands of ringgit but something basic like the house deed cannot even be settled yet,” said the 52-year-old retiree.Industry experts tell CNA that in the event that Country Garden Holdings in China defaults and goes under liquidation, there is a valid concern that residents in Johor would have to undergo an administrative process to submit proof to liquidators that they are indeed the rightful owners. This could incur some additional cost.Real estate lawyer NG Vinod of Law Chambers of VinSa and Ian, tells CNA that the China parent company would have to realise all its assets including shares it holds with its subsidiary companies in Malaysia. This includes the developer of the Danga Bay project - Country Garden Danga Bay. He adds that if Country Garden Danga Bay is liquidated, residents who do not already own their strata titles might be forced to show proof that they are indeed the owner of the unit. “The liquidator will have to verify whether that particular unit was indeed sold to this particular individual and generally, liquidators will charge a fee for doing that,” said Mr Vinod.He adds that the liquidator will likely charge a fee of “up to a couple of thousand of ringgit” to ascertain that these residents are the genuine owners of the property, further adding to their financial burden. CNA has reached out to Country Garden Malaysia for comment on whether the company is impacted by debt issues faced by its parent company in China, as well as whether residents' concerns relating to unfinished projects, property value and process of obtaining strata titles can be addressed. On what Country Garden Malaysia can do to ease residents' concerns, Mr Tan of KGV International Property Consultants stressed that the onus is on the company to clarify its financial position and whether it is impacted by the debt issues faced by the parent company. “Shaping public perception is so important,” said Mr Tan. “It's now up to Country Garden to communicate its position publicly.”Read this story in Bahasa Melayu here.

Workers walk past a construction site of residential buildings by property developer Country Garden in Kunming, Yunnan province, China, Sep 17, 2019. (File photo: Reuters/Wong Campion) 17 Aug 2023 03:42PM (Updated: 17 Aug 2023 04:25PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: The debt crisis at Country Garden, China's largest property developer before this year and once considered a financially sound company, has triggered fresh contagion fears just two years after China Evergrande Group defaulted.What could happen next?Since the sector's debt crisis unfolded in mid-2021, companies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales have defaulted, most of them private property developers.It has led to many unfinished homes, unpaid suppliers and creditors who are not only financial institutions but also ordinary folks who bought wealth management products linked to trust financing.Many offshore bonds now trade at low double- or even single-digit cents on the dollar, and their share values have shrunk 90 per cent. There is very little liquidity left in both the equity and debt markets as investors and creditors avoid the sector. With home sales already very weak, the debt crisis could delay the prospect of a recovery of both the property market and the broader Chinese economy, in which real estate is a core pillar.S&P Global Rating said on Wednesday (Aug 17) it could adjust its forecast for property sales to a ""descending staircase"" figure from an ""L"" shaped recovery, if Country Garden officially defaulted.Home-buyers could become even more wary of private developer brands, and home prices in many areas could come under greater pressure if Country Garden resorted to fire sales to raise cash.Related:Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland: Analysis‘Hang on to cash’: China’s would-be homebuyers opt to wait out housing downturnLocal government could tighten more the escrow accounts where presale funds are kept in order to ensure homes can be completed and delivered - a top priority set by Beijing.These would in turn squeeze the sector more and lead to additional defaults even among state-backed developers.How is this time different?Country Garden's quick slip into financial trouble did not shock the market as much as Evergrande's because most private developers had already defaulted. However, it emerged when the property market and the economy are in much worse shape.While Country Garden's total liabilities of 1.4 trillion yuan (US$191.7 billion) are only 59 per cent as big as those at Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, it has 3,121 projects across all China's provinces, compared to around 800 for Evergrande.Evergrande was already insolvent at the time of default, but Country Garden currently still has more assets than liabilities. Analysts warn that Country Garden could become insolvent if it had to write off large inventories, and run into negative equity if its asset values dropped over time.Is there systemic risk?This week, news of missed payments on investment products by leading trust firm Zhongrong International Trust highlighted the outsized exposure of China's US$3 trillion shadow banking sector to the property sector.Increasing defaults by developers had already raised Chinese banks' non-performing loan ratios to 4.4 per cent at the end of last year from 1.9 per cent in 2020, Moody's said.But market experts generally do not think China is on the brink of a ""Lehman moment"" with one company's failure cascading into a broader financial collapse, as financial institutions' exposure to the real estate sector has dropped in the past few years.China's property sector accounts for more than half of global new home sales and home building, and it is the largest asset class in the world, with an estimated market value of about US$62 trillion.Related:Commentary: China property giant Country Garden’s woes - the good, the bad and the very uglyChina's new home prices fall for first time this year, dimming economic outlookThe next thing to watch is how regional governments, many of which rely on real estate revenue, manage their debt. Local-government financing vehicles (LGFVs) are estimated to hold 66 trillion yuan in total debt by the International Monetary Fund.Will the central government intervene?China's Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, fuelled speculation more stimulus is on the way when it omitted the often-repeated phrase that ""houses are for living in, not for speculation"" from a statement in late July in which it pledged to adjust property policies in a timely manner.But so far no bold stimulus measures have been announced, and views are split among industry experts whether they will eventuate.Many analysts are hopeful that Beijing, which has so far refrained from state-funded bailouts, will roll out drastic measures in the coming weeks to stem the downward spiral.Some analysts, however, question the tools that Beijing can use while maintaining a balancing act between providing support to the housing market and keeping debt in check.

In uncertain economic times, she and her husband delayed plans to buy a flat in Guangzhou this year.Between China’s deflated property market and an unexpected reduction in the 36-year-old human resource manager’s household income, it was an informed and measured situation underscored by worrisome economic data.“I’ve been saving for a down payment for several years, but this year my husband’s income is very unstable,” said He, whose husband moved more than 1,000km away to Zhejiang province last month for work after being unable to find any locally for a few months.For now, she remains with their two-year-old son in Guangzhou.In the midst of a weakened property market that has yet to show a clear sign of bottoming out, in a nation struggling to cope with unprecedented demographic changes, He, like many other middle-class Chinese, is unlikely to heed words of encouragement from Beijing as authorities hope to make the big-budget consumption of goods – such as homes and cars – a driver of economic growth.“Property prices are falling, and more young people are choosing not to get married or buy a house or have children,” He said.“All of this makes me think I shouldn’t buy property this year, and instead should hang on to the cash in case something happens.”Property investment in China fell 8.5 per cent in the first seven months of 2023, year on year, marking the sharpest dip this year amid a slew of weak indicators that have clouded the prospects of achieving Beijing’s target for “around 5 per cent” economic growth this year.Related:China's property sector set to be persistently weak for years: Goldman China's new home prices fall for first time this year, dimming economic outlook“The biggest worry is the property sector, where the slump continues unabated,” Gavekal Dragonomics said in a research report on Tuesday (Aug 15).“Sales improved slightly in year-on-year terms, but declined to 60 per cent of the seasonally adjusted 2019 average in July, from 63 per cent in June.New construction projects were just 37 per cent of the 2019 level, only completions continued to post growth, thanks to ample policy support to finish stalled housing projects.“The housing decline will also weigh on the job market and consumption. Indeed, the engine of the reopening recovery – a tightening labour market that leads to higher incomes and spending – has effectively stalled,” it said.Since tightening the screws on developers in 2021, China’s property crises have weakened the health of its economy and financial markets, as seen with Evergrande’s offshore bond default in 2021 and mortgage boycotts in 2022.Related:Country Garden restructuring fears deepen concerns about China property sectorContagion fears deepened further recently as Country Garden, the country’s largest private property developer, halted trading of some onshore bonds and struggled to address liquidity stress. And state-backed Sino-Ocean missed millions of dollars in interest payments.Ren Zeping, an online influencer and economist, earlier this month called for more transparency in the housing market.“We need a rational and accurate understanding of the contribution, problems and status of the real estate market,” he said.“As a pillar industry, we cannot afford a hard landing in the property market. It matters in terms of economic growth, financial risks and job creation. Intensive efforts are needed to stabilise the property market.”Policymakers have been loosening property policies since late 2022, with regulators easing funding restrictions and more cities lifting purchasing restrictions.China’s prime decision-making body, the Politburo, said in late July that market supply-and-demand conditions have changed in the real estate sector, warranting policy adjustments.This was widely seen as the strongest indicator from Beijing that property policies would be adjusted to focus less on preventing the market from overheating and more on avoiding a hard landing while mitigating the drag on China’s economic growth.Beijing has also announced a slew of measures to revive the private economy and encourage consumption since late July.In the 20-point plan to expand consumption, issued on Jul 31, the government said it would address the housing problems for new urban residents and young people who have increasingly felt priced out of the market.However, Societe Generale expressed concerns that Beijing’s policies may not be strong enough to fuel a substantial rebound in the housing market.“The more material ones are the relaxation of housing-demand restrictions in top-tier cities. However, at this point, any solution short of a bailout of large developers might still fail to stabilise housing any time soon,” the investment bank’s Wei Yao and Michelle Lam said in a research report on Tuesday.If the capital city of Beijing does loosen home-purchasing restrictions, Wang Qiuyue intends on buying a large apartment.The department head at a small, privately owned internet firm said he has not been able to because of family-ownership restrictions that are connected to residency.Beijing is among China’s top-tier cities that have imposed the most rigid restrictions on property and automobile purchases.“I don’t have the additional budget nor time to spend on anything but repaying the mortgage and raising my boy,” said Wang, whose son turned one in July. “But I am worried, very much so, about job prospects. If I were unemployed, everything would be ruined.”In a second-quarter survey by the People’s Bank of China of 20,000 depositors in 50 cities, fewer households said they were planning to buy flats in the following three months, with the proportion dipping to 16.2 per cent from 17.5 per cent in a first-quarter survey.Meanwhile, more households expected property prices to fall in the next three months, with the proportion up to 16.5 per cent from 14.4 per cent, the survey found.Yu Qian, a 26-year-old freelance English teacher, has moved with her husband and newborn to Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province, from Zhumadian, a third-tier city nearby, seeking more lucrative work.The small family will not be buying a home for now. They are currently renting a 90sqm (968sqft) flat for 2,100 yuan (US$290) a month. The unit’s sale price is listed at 1.08 million yuan.“We are also considering buying an apartment in Zhengzhou, but I think property prices will very possibly drop next year.The liquidity and preservation value of real estate are much worse than before,” Yu said. “All of my friends who bought an apartment over the past couple of years have regretted the decision.”Cai Fang, a senior researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, flagged risks stemming from insufficient confidence in residential consumption, warning that the situation could turn chronic from even a short-term aversion to buying property, if not timely fixed.“Regarding the possible new norm involving residents’ economic activities, new ideas are required in macroeconomic policies, with stimulating consumption for starters,” Cai said in an article published by China Finance 40, a leading think tank, on Monday.Lin Suzhen, a self-employed man in his mid-forties, is still willing to consume as long as he has options.“I won’t cut my consumption budget. [I have] no plan to buy a big apartment, as it is too expensive. Overseas tourism is not easy, so I travel domestically, and that is it.If Beijing can loosen the auto-plate restrictions and grant me a quota, I would, without hesitation, spend 400,000 yuan to buy a car,” said Liu, who has participated in the city’s car-plate lottery since 2012, a year after Beijing rolled it out.Calling the stimulation of residential consumption the “most pressing” policy target, Cai said the government should take measures “by all means” to increase residential income.The government should, he said, also allow rural migrant workers to become residents with urban household registration – known as hukou – to unleash new demand.In 2019, China’s central bank said housing accounted for nearly 70 per cent of urban household assets in China – at a time when it was still widely viewed with potential investment value across the country, and as an asset to grow wealth.Eli Mai, a sales director with a foreign company in Guangzhou, saw the value of his two flats rise from 3.8 million yuan in 2016 to 6.4 million yuan in 2017. They peaked at 8 million yuan in 2021 and are now worth less than 7 million yuan.“No one knows how the economy will be in the future. Under such circumstances … you should not invest rashly,” he said.“Now, most Chinese ordinary people who own housing feel that their wealth is shrinking dramatically. That must be profoundly affecting the economy and the spending,” Mai said.Central bank data showed that outstanding mortgage loans shrank by 0.7 per cent at the end of June to 38.6 trillion yuan, compared with a year earlier.The weak demand also dragged down the new loans issued by banks. In July, the figure stood at 345.9 billion yuan, much less than the market had expected. Medium- to long-term loans to households, which are largely mortgages, fell by 67.2 billion yuan.Li Wei, a freelancing copywriter in Shenzhen, has to repay 18,000 yuan each month for three apartments bought in the late 2010s when the property was still booming and buyers were betting on persistent price hikes.“The mortgage is now a heavy burden for me,” said the 34-year-old with a two-month-old, as current market prices have fallen below what she paid.Adding to her stress, she has not yet been paid for freelance work done this year.“Overdue payments are common in the film industry,” she said. “The production company delayed payment to the advertisers, which then delayed payment to us.”This article was first published on SCMP.Related:China’s property crisis burns middle class stuck with huge loans‘She got an abortion, broke up with me’: The human suffering behind China’s property crisis Source: South China Morning Post/yb Related Topics China Housing China economy economy Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

(Photo: Reuters/Aly Song) 16 Aug 2023 04:48PM (Updated: 16 Aug 2023 04:57PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.In 2022, Country Garden made 62 per cent of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan (US$78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.""It needs at least 30 billion yuan (US$4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.Related:Commentary: China property giant Country Garden’s woes - the good, the bad and the very uglyChina's new home prices fall for first time this year, dimming economic outlookHIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGINCountry Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90 per cent drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group, which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9 per cent of local government revenues with 23.9 per cent from sales, for a total of 30.8 per cent, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50 per cent of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis are piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""Also read:Deals on wheels: Housing prices drive young Chinese into RV living‘She got an abortion, broke up with me’: The human suffering behind China’s property crisis Source: Reuters/zl Related Topics China property crisis China Evergrande Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

Bloomberg Opinion’s Shuli Ren weighs in on developer Country Garden’s possible debt restructuring. Chinese property giant Country Garden's is edging towards a default. (Photo: AFP/STR) Shuli Ren Shuli Ren 16 Aug 2023 06:02AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: Country Garden, once China’s biggest real estate developer, is edging toward a default. The distressed builder suspended trading in nearly a dozen onshore bonds on Monday (Aug 14), paving the way for debt negotiations and a possible restructuring. Investment bank China International Capital Corp (CICC) has been engaged to explore options for the company, including extending some soon-to-mature yuan notes. With about US$10 billion dollar bonds outstanding, foreign investors, of course, want to know what this will mean for their holdings, such as the recovery rate and timing of a debt workout. COUNTRY GARDEN IS NOT EVERGRANDEFirst, the good. Country Garden is not China Evergrande Group. That’s a much better-run company. It’s unlikely to have the kind of opaque web of off-balance sheet debt that Evergrande - or many other mainland developers - weaved. Its financial reports are more credible. As of the 2022 year-end, Country Garden held 87 billion yuan (U$12 billion) in unrestricted cash, excluding that in escrow accounts. That money will probably be used to deliver unfinished projects, rather than shifted to repay some hidden debt somewhere. Now, the bad. In a restructuring scenario, investors are unlikely to see any money upfront. Exchanging their notes for payment-in-kind bonds - a feature distressed firms often use to preserve cash - is very much on the cards. Country Garden’s Achilles’ heel is a heavy exposure to smaller cities, which are plagued by housing oversupply and population outflows. What doesn’t help either is that the government has shifted its easing policy to larger, more resilient cities, hardly benefiting the builder. Sales will take time to recover. By the company’s own account, it needs about 28 billion yuan to 30 billion yuan in sales a month to generate enough cash and be able to finish pre-sold projects. However, it hasn’t hit the break-even point this year, and the past few months have been even worse.There is no doubt that Country Garden is going through a liquidity crisis. Investors will have to be patient and accept that there are no payouts in the immediate future. RESTRUCTURING IS NOT A GIVENNow here comes the outright ugly. It’s possible that Country Garden’s dollar bonds will be in default for a long time and there’s no restructuring whatsoever. A company will propose debt workouts only if its shareholders still see value and want to turn the page. Related:Commentary: Is China stumbling into its own mortgage crisis?Commentary: Evergrande woes show China’s overreliance on property market for growthBut does billionaire businesswoman Yang Huiyan, who held a 52.6 per cent stake as of the end of July, still have faith in Country Garden’s turnaround, despite a history of funding support? Her outsize ownership can materially change the builder’s financial policy and its attitude toward bond holders. In China, capital-intensive real estate development is long past its prime, while property management and services are the future. Indeed, in the first half, Country Garden Services Holdings Co is expected to report up to 2.6 billion yuan in net profit, while the troubled development unit may see up to 55 billion yuan in net loss.To figure out whether the distressed tycoons are willing to negotiate on debt, it’s important to look at the relationship between their business divisions. END OF THE ROADCall me hard-nosed, but Yang may no longer care. Country Garden and Country Garden Services are sister companies, both ultimately controlled by Yang. In late July, the 41-year-old gave about 55 per cent of her personal stake in the property management unit to a charity founded by her sibling, while keeping the voting rights. The charity will hold the shares for 10 years. This corporate structure is in stark contrast to, say, Sun Hongbin’s empire. Sunac Services Holdings is controlled by the development unit, Sunac China Holdings. As such, the billionaire has a financial incentive to restructure Sunac China and even offer sweeteners. Whatever happens to Country Garden, most investors can agree on one thing: For two years, the builder has tried hard to honour its obligations even as others became delinquent amid the government’s harsh regulatory crackdowns. Country Garden is just at the end of the road.

The debt financing tools, dubbed ""the second arrow"" and supported by PBOC refinancing, were launched in 2018.""Supporting the development of private firms is the duty of financial departments. It is also an important part of the supply-side structural reform in the financial sector,"" a PBOC statement said, citing Pan. ""Financial institutions should actively create a positive atmosphere to support the development and growth of private firms ... and increase willingness to lend.""China last month unveiled a series of policy measures designed to help private businesses after the sector has been bruised by COVID-19 curbs and a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown that targeted industries from technology to property.The PBOC will support local governments to take the initiative to clear arrears owed to firms, learn about private firms' financial needs and respond to their concerns and appeals, according to the statement. As some private property firms still failed to get out of the woods, the PBOC vowed it would meet reasonable financing demand for them and implement differentiated housing credit policies in a precise manner.China's property sector has over the past two years been grappling with a severe debt crisis - initially triggered by government moves to rein in ballooning debt - with many developers defaulting on payments as they struggle to sell apartments and raise funds.Attendees of the meeting included heads of three property firms Longfor Properties , Midea Real Estate Holding, CIFI's property firm and diary giant Yili Group, aluminium products manufacturer China Hongqiao Group, electrical components manufacturer Chint Group, agribusiness firm New Hope and apparel products manufacturer Hongdou.To revive confidence among private businesses, head of the economic planner also held several meetings with private firms last month to learn about their operation difficulties. The cabinet last week also asked the public to report obstacles in the private economy growth.

The world's No.2 economy staged a better-than-expected recovery in the first quarter following COVID reopening but has lost steam since the April-June quarter as demand waned both at home and abroad. The People's Bank of China's (PBOC) statement followed a meeting at which officials from the bank and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) looked to the second half of the year.As the property sector had failed to get out of the woods yet, the PBOC pledged it would support a ""stable and healthy development"" of the real estate market, including continuing to guide the reduction of personal housing loan interest rates and downpayment ratios, according to the statement. The PBOC will also guide commercial banks to adjust rates on existing mortgages in a legal and orderly manner.A private survey showed on Tuesday average new home prices in 100 Chinese cities fell for a third consecutive month in July.China will also pay close attention to cross-border capital fluctuations, keep the yuan basically stable and step up support for firms to hedge exchange rate risks, the PBOC statement said.To ease pressure on the yuan, Chinese currency regulators have in recent weeks asked some commercial banks to reduce or delay their dollar purchases, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The country will also coordinate financial support on the settlement of local government debt risks and effectively fend off financial risks in key areas, the statement said. Pan Gongsheng, the PBOC governor as well as the head of SAFE, spoke at the meeting.

China's property sector has seen a string of debt defaults by cash-squeezed developers over the past few years and is showing few signs of recovery. Top leaders at a Politburo meeting recently pledged to adjust and optimise policies in a timely manner to help prop up the sector.Future policy optimization measures are expected mainly in the core tier-two and tier-one cities, as restrictive policies of the property market in most tier-two and tier-three and four cities have been relaxed, the China Index Academy said.Measures may involve easing mortgage curbs, ""reducing the down payment ratio, mortgage interest rate, transaction taxes and fees, and relaxing housing purchase curbs in some areas"", it added.Tier-one cities including Beijing and Shenzhen have already vowed to implement measures, without giving details.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/FILE PHOTO 31 Jul 2023 02:49PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG/NEW YORK : For all the excitement whipped up in China's markets by the Politburo last week, foreign investors say policymakers' words will have to be matched by substantive action to clean up an ailing property sector before confidence recovers.The sector accounts for a quarter of China's economy, yet developers' debts are sliding deeper into distressed territory, with repayment problems mounting while sales crumble.When the Politburo signalled that there would be changes to real estate policy, along with other measures to boost an economy, it ignited the biggest one-day buying spree in China's stock markets since 2021.The July 25 rally was enough to lift the benchmark index into positive territory for the year, but a sustained upturn would depend on policymakers making good on their - so far vague - promises.""Foreign investors may have started buying more Chinese equities in the hopes that the Politburo was going to herald big, meaningful stimulus, but we would wait until we see more specific measures,"" said Tara Hariharan, managing director at global macro hedge fund NWI Management LP.""The question is what resources they will deploy, because China is still very focused on de-leveraging and preventing financial risks.""The sorry state of developers' balance sheets sits right at the top of the risk list.""Is real estate worth rescuing under China’s current economic model? Absolutely, and urgently,"" said Qi Wang, the chief investment officer (CIO) of MegaTrust Investment (HK), a boutique China fund manager specializing in domestic Chinese A-shares.But investors should be cautious and patient, said Wang, noting the lack of detail from Politburo last week. China “requires more drastic measures than what we have today,"" Wang wrote on his Substack.Finding a way to restore the property sector's health would have greater impact on the economy, than tax cuts or growth in the technology sector would deliver.It would unlock consumer spending by homeowners who have lost faith in a housing market, where they have stored their wealth.Mark Dong, general manager of Minority Asset Management, based in Hong Kong, has reduced his exposure to the property sector. ""The sentiment is bottoming, but there is lack of catalyst. It seems that there are no substantive measures yet to help developers, such as bailing out the troubled developers. ""A national-level loosening, such as cutting loan down-payment ratios, is the sort of big gesture necessary, said Bo Zhuang, a senior analyst on the macro strategies group at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia.'SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING'Jingjing Weng, head of Chinese equities research at Eastspring Investments in Shanghai said last week's rally was largely driven by short-covering.""The key is when and what specific measures will be followed,"" said Weng. ""Investors are still more on a 'wait and see' approach as they need to see a more sustainable rally in the Chinese equity markets before going back in.""Foreigners' net stock purchases of 19 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) on July 25 were the largest one-day rush in a year and a half. For the year, however, net buying sits around 230 billion yuan, having more or less stalled after net inflow of 186 billion yuan in the first quarter as economy lost its post-pandemic bounce.Rob Hinchliffe, portfolio manager portfolio manager and head of global sector cluster research at PineBridge Investments, based in New York said their exposure to China is lower than a year ago.Investing, Hinchliffe said, is ""somewhat challenging in China, given some of the top-down decisions that are made. We are underweight China overall now.”Wai Mei Leong, fixed income lead portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments, says her fund only picks property firms owned or affiliated to the government and the sector's recovery will drag on for 2 to 3 years. NO CONFIDENCEAnxiety over the debts that developers were carrying had festered for much of the past decade. The crunch came three years ago, when worried authorities restricted developers' borrowing and upended a business model that depended on loans and pre-sales to fund construction.China Evergrande Group, the most indebted developer, collapsed and unfinished projects dotting cities froze the market.As the relaxation of COVID-controls failed to bring a sustained rebound in sales, even the more stable developers such as Country Garden started to struggle with cash flow.Speculators brave enough to put money in developers' stocks and bonds last year were rewarded by the rally sparked by the Politburo's assurances. But larger players say that is no basis for longer-term investing given the fundamental problems developers are facing.""No one's got confidence on how these companies are going to survive,"" said one fund manager looking after an emerging market credit portfolio for a U.S. asset manager, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak publicly.""Without asset sales or selling of houses - which is declining - how are they going to come up with the cash?"" he said. The safest bets in the sector, he said, had come down to state-owned companies such as China Resources Land and Poly Property.($1 = 7.1640 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Additional reporting by Xie Yu and Georgina Lee in Hong Kong, Shen Yiming and Jason Xue in Shanghai and Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Writing by Tom Westbrook, Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Simon Cameron-Moore) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo 28 Jul 2023 09:52AM (Updated: 28 Jul 2023 11:08AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING :China needs more effective implementation measures such as lower home mortgage rates and down payment ratios for first-time home buyers to help spur home purchases, state media quoted the housing minister as saying, sparking a rally in property shares. Speaking at a recent symposium with property developers and construction firms, Ni Hong, minister of housing and urban-rural development, underlined the significance of meeting residents' essential housing demand and their needs for better living conditions, Xinhua reported late Thursday.Ni promised efforts to ensure the delivery of presold homes and said mortgage granted to homebuyers could be based on the number of houses they own rather than on their previous mortgage loan record, urging more action across the sector to consolidate the recovery of the property market.He also called for reduction in tax rates for people who want to upgrade their homes. China CSI Real Estate index rose roughly 2 per cent on Friday on Ni's reported comments. ""Overall, this move is reasonable, and we expect easing could intensify if sales remain weak,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note on Friday, adding the second-home down payment ratio may be subsequently lowered as well. China's property sector has over the past two years been grappling with a severe debt crisis - initially triggered by government moves to rein in ballooning debt - with many developers defaulting on payments as they struggle to sell apartments and raise funds.""Stabilizing the construction and property sectors is significant to promoting a broader economic recovery,"" Xinhua said, citing the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.Ni said the ministry has urged building companies and property developers to actively participate in affordable housing projects, the renovation of villages in cities, and public facility construction.""It is necessary to deepen the structural reform of the housing supply side, strengthen scientific and technological empowerment, improve the quality of housing, and build 'good houses' for the people,"" he said.China's housing market has been a thorn in the country's economic growth, especially more recently, and the government has been stepping up efforts to prop up the debt-ladened and underperforming industry.Goldman Sachs analysts recently said China's property sector is expected to grapple with ""persistent weakness"" for years.

S&P said asset sales at parent Dalian Wanda, which is chaired by Wang Jianlin, once China's richest man, were so far insufficient to support Wanda Commercial. Dalian Wanda Group declined to comment.""Based on our understanding, the company currently only has about $200 million in accessible offshore cash,"" S&P said of Wanda Commercial, with further funds already pledged against onshore borrowing.""Given the tight timeline,"" it said ""execution risk"" was high and lowered its rating on the company's debts to ""speculative grade"" CCC. Moody's cut it to Caa1, which is one notch on the rating ladder above S&P's score. But it also cut Wanda Commercial Properties HK to an even lower Caa3.""There is high uncertainty over DWCM's ability to address its debt repayment due in the next 3-6 months, including its $400 million bond maturity due on 23 July,"" Moody's said, adding that the company's ability to mobilise its cash was in question.A default by Wanda, which had managed to sell new bonds at the beginning of year, including to international funds such as Blackrock, Fidelity, Pictet and Invesco, would signal another leg in China's long-running property crisis. Wanda Commercial's bonds have slumped dramatically this week as concerns about its fate have mounted, although Thursday's moves were highly volatile.A Bloomberg report that some of DWCM's creditors had been told the firm expects to complete an asset disposal as early as this week to fund the $400 million bond payment saw the key bond due on Sunday leap almost 40 cents at one point, traders said.Wanda Commercial's 2025 and 2026 maturing bonds rose over 5 cents, Tradeweb data showed, although that still left both bonds at less than a third of their original face value.ECHO OF EVERGRANDE Other high profile but debt-strained China property names also suffered sizable sell-offs this week as more negative news has emerged around the sector that contributed around 25 per cent of China's GDP before it was battered by a government crackdown and collapse in home sales over the last couple of years.Since the poster-child of the crisis, China Evergrande, defaulted in 2021 there has been a rash of other defaults that have left swathes of uncompleted housing projects in their wake.June data on Monday showed the largest monthly slump in property sales this year and with fresh defaults - even at state-backed builders - more pressure is building on the sector. The trustee for state-backed developer Greenland Holdings' dollar bond said last week the developer has defaulted on the notes worth $432 million, while Sino-Ocean Group proposed this week to extend the repayment for a 2 billion yuan onshore bond due Aug 2. Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer, on Monday posted a combined loss of $81 billion in 2021 and 2022 and a rise in total liabilities in its long overdue results.

Prices were also unchanged from a year earlier, retreating from a 0.1 per cent increase in May.The property sector, accounting for one-fourth of activity in the world's second-biggest economy, slumped sharply last year as developers defaulted on debts and suspended construction of presold housing projects.The central and local governments and regulators have announced a slew of policies over the past year to prop up the sector.Measures have ranged from extended financial support for developers to multi-pronged incentives for home buyers. But the uncertain economic outlook and persistent weakness in the sector have dented confidence and home demand, dampening hopes for any quick revival.Weakness in home prices and falling exports are adding to pressure on policymakers to take do more to prop up the real estate and revive sluggish demand.Markets widely expect more stimulus around a meeting of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo late this month, setting the tone for economic policies in the second half of the year.""The property market is in dire need of strong policies to boost confidence as small-scale policies can no longer rescue the dwindling sentiment,"" said analyst Chen Xiao at property data provider Zhuge House Hunter.Policies such as boosting employment and incomes must strengthened to support home buying, Chen said.Thirty-one of the 70 cities monitored by NBS recorded month-on-month rises in new home prices, down from 46 in May. Prices were flat after rising in May in tier-one cities including Beijing and tier-two cities. They fell 0.1 per cent in tier-three cities.There is room for ""marginal optimisation"" of property polices considering profound changes in supply and demand in the real estate market, Zou Lan, a senior official at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said on Friday.""PBOC officials hinted at further property policy easing in the press conference on Friday, and we expect the July Politburo meeting to emphasise the need to stabilise the property market,"" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research note. The central bank on Monday extended until the end of 2024 some policies in a November rescue package for the cash-strapped sector. But the uncertain economic outlook and weakness in the sector have dented confidence, dampening hopes of any quick revival.A quarterly PBOC survey showed 16.5 per cent of households believe housing prices will fall in the third quarter, down from the previous quarter, when 14.4 per cent of households expected a decline.

China's exports fell last month at their fastest pace since the onset three years ago of the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed on Thursday. The economy likely grew 7.3 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier due to a low base, according to a forecast of Monday's data in a Reuters poll, but momentum is rapidly faltering. The central bank cut the RRR - the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - in March, and cut its benchmark lending rates by a modest 10 basis points in June, the first such reduction in 10 months.Analysts polled by Reuters expect the central bank to cut the RRR by 25 basis points in the third quarter.Downward price pressure is building as consumer prices teetered on the edge of deflation and producer deflation worsened in June. But Liu said China has not seen deflation and there were no deflationary risks for the second half.YUAN STABILITY, PROPERTY SUPPORTChina will keep the yuan basically stable and prevent sharp fluctuations, Liu said, adding that the currency will be underpinned by China's economic recovery, a current account surplus that is about 2 per cent of GDP and foreign exchange reserves of more than $3 trillion.""We have the confidence, conditions and ability to cope with various shocks and maintain the smooth operation of the foreign exchange market,"" Liu said. ""As for the specific policy tools, we will use them reasonably according to the needs of the situation.""The currency rose on Friday, partly on Liu's reassurances.Zou said there was room for making ""marginal optimisation"" of property polices considering profound changes in supply and demand in the real estate market.Special loans worth 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) to help developers finish pre-sold housing projects will be extended to May 2024, Zou said.

""In the second quarter, the pace of market recovery slowed and there was not enough momentum for prices to rise,"" it added.China's property sector has over the past two years been thrust into a severe debt crisis - initially triggered by government moves to rein in ballooning debt - with many developers defaulting on payments as they struggle to sell apartments and raise funds.Although local governments have rolled out hundreds of measures to support the sector, and the scrapping of harsh COVID curbs in December has helped somewhat, positive investor sentiment towards the sector has been short-lived.""If policy support is limited, it will be difficult for home buyer confidence to improve,"" China Index Academy said.The property sector accounts for a roughly a quarter of China's economy.

Prices were down 0.8 per cent in March.Beijing's aggressive stimulus policies to the crisis-hit property sector since November have boosted sentiment over the past few months. But uncertainty over the strength of the revival lingers amid an overall patchy economic recovery.As part of a broader push for the economy to emerge from the pandemic, an increasing number of Chinese cities have introduced support measures or relaxed rules for first-time home buyers.Last week, China's housing regulator issued a notice that requires local real estate brokers to reduce fees for housing transactions and leasing services to promote healthy development of the sector.Medium-to-long term loans extended to households, mostly mortgages, dwindled by 115.6 billion yuan (US$16.72 billion) in April, according to a breakdown of credit data on Thursday.

COVID-19 lockdowns and movement controls also hurt buyer sentiment.Sales have rebounded in major cities in recent weeks, as homebuyers return after Beijing abandoned its zero-COVID policy in December, but consumer confidence remains fickle.

In 2014, China issued rules requiring real estate owners to register their holdings with authorities but faced heavy resistance from local governments unwilling to open up their books.A unified real estate database for the entire country is seen as vital for the central government to regulate the housing market and also force corrupt local officials to disclose multiple properties purchased with illicit funds, industry experts say.China has completed the system after 10 years of hard work, Xinhua reported, citing Minister of Natural Resources Wang Guanghua at a work conference. More than 790 million real estate registration certificates have been issued nationwide over the past decade, according to state television. A unified real estate registration system with a national database of information on ownership would also pave the way for China to implement a property tax in the future.

Official data for March showed home prices rise at the fastest pace in 21 months although property investment continued its decline.Home buyers are regaining confidence in property developers and ""if pre-sold housing is digested by the market, property developers should be able to get fresh cash flow from home sales in 2024,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist at ING for Greater China.China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace in the first quarter, as the end of strict COVID curbs lifted businesses and consumers out of crippling pandemic disruptions, although headwinds from a global slowdown point to a bumpy ride ahead.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang 15 Apr 2023 09:49AM (Updated: 17 Apr 2023 07:05AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING :China's new home prices rose in March at the fastest pace in 21 months, official data showed on Saturday, suggesting the market is out of the doldrums amid a flurry of support policies, but there is uncertainty on the strength of the momentum.New home prices in March edged up 0.5 per cent month-on-month after a 0.3 per cent rise in February, marking the fastest pace since June 2021 and the third consecutive monthly rise, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data.Prices in annual terms showed the smallest drop since June 2022, down 0.8 per cent in March after a 1.2 per cent decline in February, the 11th month of declines on an annual basis.""The housing price index shows a trend of stabilization and recovery, fully indicating the overall real estate is out of last year's trough,"" said Yan Yuejin, an analyst at the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.Strong home sales in March drove up an improvement in house prices, said Yan.The property sector, accounting for roughly a quarter of China's economy, was hit hard last year as a regulatory crackdown on developers' high debt levels snowballed into a financing crunch, stalling construction on housing projects. Some buyers boycotted mortgage repayments, further weakening consumer sentiment amid tough COVID restrictions.Major cities have seen a rebound in home sales over the past month, as pent-up demand was unleashed after China abruptly rolled back COVID curbs in December.Among 70 cities surveyed by the NBS, 64 cities saw an uptick in new home prices in monthly terms, the most cities since May 2019 and up from 55 in February.The increase in house prices was broad-based among all city tiers which all extended their month-on-month gains.However, analysts say it is still too early to tell whether the nascent property recovery will be sustained, because of the uncertainty over consumer confidence.""The property sector recovery should be gradual and bumpy, due to the challenging demographic trend, still-tight financing conditions for troubled developers and policymakers' long-held stance that 'housing is for living in, not for speculation',"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs commenting on the data.Last month, more than 50 cities introduced stimulus policies or relaxed some property rules, including subsidies, more housing provident funds and easing home purchase curbs.""The biggest problem in the economy is insufficient demand with increasing deflationary pressure, the continued stabilization of real estate is critical as recent data showing sales growth has slowed,"" said Wu Jinhui, analyst at CSCI Pengyuan Credit Rating Limited.""In the second quarter, there is room for policy relaxation on both the supply and demand side, such as a balance sheet improvement for high-quality property firms, smaller down payments and cuts in mortgage rates.""Credit data this week suggested the growth of household medium-to-long term loans, which are mostly mortgages, accelerated in March, in line with improved property transactions.Earlier in April, the central bank released a quarterly survey of urban depositors that showed 17.5 per cent of respondents have plans to buy a home during the next three months, up from 16 per cent in the previous quarterly survey.China will release property sales and investment data for March on Tuesday, along with economic activity data and first quarter gross domestic product (GDP).

REUTERS/Aly Song 16 Mar 2023 09:47AM (Updated: 16 Mar 2023 01:38PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING :China's home prices gained momentum nationally in February, rising for a second consecutive month driven by pent-up demand even in smaller cities, but prices have yet to recoup all their losses and there remains a sizable stock of unsold homes.Average new home prices in February edged up 0.3 per cent month-on-month from a 0.1 per cent gain in January, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, the fastest pace since July 2021.Since mid-2021, the property sector has grappled with a liquidity crisis, with developers delaying or defaulting on debt payments as they struggled to sell apartments and raise funds. Battered sentiment improved after China's abrupt U-turn in December on its restrictive zero-COVID policy, with some home buyers trickling back into the market in January. ""The (February) reading came as a surprise to me as national home prices are expected to remain low in the first half of the year before rising in the second half,"" said analyst Ma Hong at Zhixin Investment Research Institute, who attributed the price gain to pent-up demand spurred by supportive policies.Current home prices remain a little lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2021 when the downward cycle of prices started, he said.In annual terms, prices fell 1.2 per cent, marking the slowest pace in seven months and narrowing from a 1.5 per cent drop in January.In February, 55 of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS saw growth in new home prices month-on-month, up from 36 cities in the previous month.Among the 66 tier-two and tier-three cities, 51 saw new home prices rise in February, compared with 34 cities in January.China's yuan strengthened on Thursday, as signs the property market is stabilising raised expectations of a broader economic recovery after Beijing dropped its zero-COVID strategy. UNSOLD HOMESThe large number of unsold new homes in small and medium-sized cities clouded the outlook for a continued rebound in the sector, analysts said.Developers are still under great pressure to reduce their stock of unsold homes, said Liu Lijie, analyst at Beike research institute.""Despite the apparent stabilization in property prices, its sustainability remains unclear. Beijing may have to do more to instill confidence in the property sector,"" Nomura analysts said in a note commenting on the data.Official data on Wednesday showed the area of unsold homes stood at 655 million square metres as of the end of February.A manager at a large real estate firm said second- and third-tier cities were unlikely to see a sharp drop in new housing inventory ""as market confidence has only just been restored"" there.Official data for January-February on Wednesday showed much narrower declines in home sales, developer investment and construction starts, suggesting the real estate sector was stabilising.Local governments continued to step up efforts to boost demand this year with around 30 cities optimising policies on provident housing funds, such as allowing smaller down payments and more loans.By the end of 2022, outstanding mortgages grew by just 1.2 per cent to 38.8 trillion yuan ($5.6 trillion), decelerating by 10 per centage points from the end of the previous year, according to central bank data.($1 = 6.8993 Chinese yuan) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Aly Song 15 Mar 2023 11:03AM (Updated: 15 Mar 2023 05:26PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING : China's embattled property sector made new progress in its climb out of a months-long slump as official data for January-February on Wednesday showed much narrower declines in home sales, developer investment and construction starts.Home sales by floor area in the first two months of 2023 fell 3.6 per cent from a year earlier, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), compared with a 24 per cent decline for the whole of 2022. The narrower sales decline followed a rise in new home prices in January, the first uptick in a year, as buyers, while still cautious, found solace in a slew of supportive policies, expectations of more stimulus steps and China's exit from its crushing zero-COVID regime. Property investment by developers in January-February was down 5.7 per cent on the same period of 2022, improving on December's 12 per cent annual slump and a 10 per cent decline for the entire 2022.Analysts expect property sales to be the first indicator to turn positive soon. They see property investment rebounding in the second half of 2023.""The figures are a good start to the recovery of the property market for 2023, and will further boost confidence,"" said Yan Yuejin, analyst at the E-house China Research and Development Institution in Shanghai.""Property sales figures are expected to turn from negative to positive in the first quarter of the year, the biggest sign that the property market is recovering.""An index tracking China's real estate shares rose 1.4 per cent on Wednesday, while Hong Kong-listed mainland property developers climbed more than 2.5 per cent.Sentiment for China's property sector, for years a pillar of growth in the world's second-biggest economy, has been crushed by multiple crises since mid-2021, including developers' debt defaults and stalled construction of pre-sold housing projects.DEMAND BOOSTThe lifting of COVID-19 restrictions late in 2022 and release of funds to developers for ensuring delivery of pre-sold projects would boost demand, said analyst Ma Hong at Zhixin Investment Research Institute. ""Investment by developers, a key indicator of market performance, will likely rise in the second half of the year, meaning not only an overall rebound, but also a substantial improvement in the operating conditions of real estate companies,"" Ma said. New construction starts measured by floor area in January-February fell 9.4 per cent from a year earlier versus a 44 per cent plunge seen in December and a 39 per cent tumble for the whole of 2022. Developers' access to funds has also improved. Developers raised 15 per cent less funds in the first two months of 2023 than a year earlier. In all of 2022, their fund raising was down 26 per cent on 2021.""Real estate companies face a peak period of debt repayment in the first half of the year, and will only have the will and ability to expand their investments once sales and financing have grown,"" said Zhixin's Ma.The NBS did not release land sales data. In 2022, developers bought 53 per cent less land than in 2021. The bureau did not respond to a Reuters request seeking comment on why the data was not released.Developers were still under great pressure to reduce their stock of unsold homes, since the quantity had risen, said Liu Lijie, analyst at Beike research institute. But the companies' confidence in getting financing and in buying land had improved marginally, Liu said. Around half of the 30-odd Chinese developers listed in Hong Kong have defaulted on or delayed bond payments.At the beginning of the annual meeting of China's parliament this month, the government made guarding against risks to top property developers one of its top priorities this year, but added that it would prevent disorderly expansion by developers.

(File photo: Reuters/Edgar Su) Chew Hui Min @ChewHuiMinCNA Chew Hui Min 23 Feb 2023 06:00AM (Updated: 23 Feb 2023 09:53AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The easing of COVID-19 measures in China is likely to see a renewed interest from its nationals in buying property in Singapore, but not in such numbers that prices here will be affected much, property analysts said.With China abandoning its COVID-zero stance and the easing of all pandemic restrictions in Singapore, buyers are expected to return to the local property market.""We expect more foreign buyers and permanent residents to return to Singapore’s property market, especially with the reopening of China’s international borders,"" said Ms Christine Sun, senior vice president of research & analytics at OrangeTee & Tie.""Many mainland Chinese buyers may start travelling here after the Chinese New Year holidays. Some may come to work, study or conduct business. Some may rent while they take time to settle down in Singapore.""Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons also said that foreign buyers are ""back in force in January"", picking up 57 units in January, 58.3 per cent higher than the month before.In the past decade, mainland Chinese buyers have made up the biggest group of foreign buyers of property here.In a written parliamentary reply in January, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee shared a table of the percentage of private residential property transactions by Singapore citizens, foreigners, permanent residents and companies for the last 10 years.The share of units purchased by Singaporeans went up from 73.7 per cent in 2013 to 82.6 per cent in 2021. It then decreased slightly to 79.9 per cent in 2022 which is similar to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2019.The proportion of private homes bought by permanent residents has hovered around around 13 to 16 per cent in the last 10 years, while the proportion of foreigners buying homes has fallen, from 7 to 8 per cent 10 years ago to 3.5 per cent in 2022.But even with an expected resurgence of interest, it is unlikely that this would have much of an impact on the local property market as purchases by foreigners form a tiny minority of overall deals, said PropNex CEO Ismail Gafoor.He pointed out that last year, 78 per cent of the non-landed private residential transactions were by Singaporean buyers with foreigners only accounting for 4.8 per cent. Singapore permanent residents accounted for about 17.6 per cent of sales.""Chinese buyers tend to make up a sizable proportion of sales to foreigners, but they still only account for a fraction of total transactions,"" he said. ""Singaporean buyers continue to dominate home sales.""In 2022, foreign Chinese buyers bought 241 non-landed private homes in Singapore, which is 26.5 per cent of transactions by foreign buyers – but it contributed only about 1.3 per cent of total transactions for condo sales, he said.Last year's sales to foreign Chinese buyers were the lowest since 2010, according to data compiled by PropNex. But figures from the last decade show that the number of transactions has not gone above 700 units, or more than 3.6 per cent of total sales. It has also come down in the last four years to fewer than 500 units a year. Related:Impact of rise in buyer’s stamp duty falls mainly on luxury properties: AnalystsIf PRs are included, the number of condominiums purchased by mainland Chinese buyers in 2022 was 1,351, fewer than the 1,738 units bought in 2021, said Ms Sun.In terms of proportion, the number of condos bought by mainland Chinese buyers, both permanent residents and non-PRs, rose from 5.9 per cent in 2021 to 6.9 per cent in 2022, she said.""Although mainland Chinese buyers are the top foreign buyers, they still constitute a small proportion of buyers in the market. Therefore, they may not cause overall prices to surge too much,"" said Ms Sun.Related:More ultra-wealthy families setting up offices in Singapore, and they’re not just coming from AsiaCOVID-weary Chinese millionaires eye Singapore amid ‘chaos and unpredictability’ at home""GUARDRAILS"" FOR PROPERTY MARKETAnd while there are likely to be more foreigners entering the market, property analyst Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty Network, noted that the uncertain economic environment may limit demand. Singapore's official growth forecast for 2023 is pegged at 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, lower than 2022's 3.6 per cent. Demand for property tends to increase in tandem when the economic outlook is buoyant, Mr Mak said, likening it to a tide that brings in more buyers.""This time round, the tide is not coming in at full speed ... so could that also bring more caution among these foreign buyers?"" he said.Mr Mak said that foreign buyers also are put off by the high Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD), which is 30 per cent. For PRs buying their first property, the ABSD is 5 per cent, going up to 25 per cent for the second property and 30 per cent for subsequent ones.""They would rather rent first ... then when they get their PR, then they buy private property,"" he said.He added that Singaporeans need not worry about foreigners pushing up property prices.""I think for majority of Singaporeans, eight out of 10 buy HDB flats. The Government has put in enough guardrails to ensure that foreigners don't come in to speculate,"" he said.Mr Lam Chern Woon, head of research and consulting at Edmund Tie noted that the proportion of foreign purchases in private homes climbed to 9.2 per cent in January, up from 8.3 per cent in December, as China's border reopens.""Moving forward, we expect (the) share of foreign purchases to inch up in 2023, on the back of China’s reopening, with demand from mainland Chinese for private homes in Singapore expected to gradually recover in 2023.""But he projects prices to grow at just 1 to 3 per cent for 2023, down from 2022’s 8.6 per cent, amid projected slower economic growth and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds.Related:Commentary: Taxing the wealthy makes sense when there is little room for higher income tax or GSTMORE INTEREST FROM CHINESE TO MOVE TO SINGAPOREThe potential interest in the local property market identified by analysts comes as companies that help foreigners relocate told CNA that they have seen a spike in enquiries from China nationals who are keen to move to Singapore.Reuters reported last month that Singapore has seen a ""fresh influx of wealth since 2021"" after many Chinese became disillusioned with China's draconian COVID policies, citing skyrocketing golf memberships and lawyers who set up family offices. Singapore's number of family offices - which handle investments and financial matters for the ultra-rich - grew to about 700 family offices, up from 400 in end-2020 and up sevenfold from 2017, according to government estimates.The Monetary Authority of Singapore reported in October that Singapore’s asset management industry grew 16 per cent in 2021 to reach S$5.4 trillion, with 78 per cent of funds sourced from outside Singapore.This comes also as Singapore's population of PRs and foreigners rebounded to nearly pre-COVID levels. After two years of decline, the non-resident population grew by 6.6 per cent to 1.56 million from 2021, but was still lower than the pre-COVID level of 1.68 million in 2019. AnjiaSG, which helps Chinese clients with relocating to Singapore and buying property here, said it is getting five to six times more people asking them about their services, compared with about 100 enquiries it received each month during the COVID-19 pandemic.Mr Leo Kwek, an international real estate investment consultant at AnjiaSG, said the increase started in April last year, before China announced its reopening and around the time that Shanghai went into lockdown again for COVID-19.Another immigration and relocation firm, AIMS, saw queries jump from ""about 10 a week to 10 a day"", going up about five to six times in total, from the second quarter of 2022.CEO Pearce Cheng said: ""The spike (in interest) was very obvious ... but they were having problems renewing their passports.""Even so, his firm helped 10 to 12 Chinese clients a month move to Singapore last year, which is about double the number of clients they saw before the pandemic. LIFT FOR LUXURY MARKET?One segment of the property market that may gain in 2023 after the lifting of border measures by China is the luxury market, some analysts said.Mr Lee said that super-wealthy Chinese were said to be behind some of the purchases in Klimt Cairnhill in January, pushing the project to become the number three bestselling project that month. Fourteen out of 17 units at Klimt Cairnhill were sold to foreigners.""This could be the year where the luxury market sees more high-profile deals with the return of super-wealthy Chinese,"" he said. Mr Gafoor said that based on non-landed new home sales transactions, Chinese buyers typically prefer residential properties in the Core Central Region, particularly in Districts 9 and 10, which is the Orchard area. But the increase in foreign buying interest is not expected to significantly impact this part of property market, as Singaporean buyers accounted for the bulk of home sales for higher-end properties as well, he added.One reason why people think there are more Chinese buyers than there are in reality is the attention-grabbing anecdotes and news stories about high-value deals, said Professor Qian Wenlan, director of the National University of Singapore's Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies.But the data does not show any ""significant upward trend"" of foreign Chinese buyers acquiring homes in Singapore, she said.""By and large, headlining transactions covered in the media or frequently discussed, are outliers such as high-end or luxury condos which are not typical of the market,"" she said.""There could be an impression that Chinese buyers are entering the market, targeting certain upscale submarkets that get covered by news ... but actually, in the data, we don't see that in a typical transaction.""Related:China reopens borders in final farewell to zero-COVID Source: CNA/hm Related Topics immigration China property Housing luxury properties Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Aly Song/Files 02 Feb 2023 01:47PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING : Many Chinese cities have rushed to lower or even scrap the floor on mortgage rates for first-time home buyers in recent weeks, a research firm report said on Thursday, as authorities eased rules further in their bid to rekindle demand for residential property.The Chinese central bank on Jan. 6 said it was allowing some cities with home prices falling month-on-month and year-on-year for three consecutive months to cut or abolish the floor on mortgage rates for first-home buyers.At least 26 cities have taken such measures, including the mega-city of Tianjin and some provincial capitals like Zhengzhou and Fuzhou, according to a report by Shanghai-based firm E-house China Research and Development Institute. China's real estate market slumped sharply last year, with home prices and sales falling, property developers defaulting on debts and even stopping construction of new projects amid curbs on excessive borrowing and COVID-19 containment measures.There are signs of a recovery in the sector, thanks to a flurry of state support measures and the government's lifting of strict anti-COVID policies in December. Fragile demand, however, is still a key constraint on a full recovery.Last month, home sales by floor area fell around 20 per cent from a year earlier, extending declines from December, as many home buyers hugged the sidelines even though visits to view housing projects in several key cities have increased, according to a China Index Academy report released on Wednesday. A central bank quarterly survey in December showed only 16 per cent of residents polled planned to buy a home in the subsequent three months, the lowest since the third quarter of 2016.""Still, more support is likely in coming months to stimulate demand, and the recovery trajectory of contracted sales will depend on the timeliness and effectiveness of further new measures,"" said Kelly Chen, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst in a research note.

(File photo: Chinatopix Via AP) 27 Jan 2023 04:55PM (Updated: 27 Jan 2023 05:05PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn China’s older generation invested considerable savings in property, buying up homes and flats that would hopefully appreciate over the years, but times are changingWhile Chinese leaders still consider real estate to be a pillar of the nation’s economy, investor confidence appears to be waning among members of Generation ZOnce a primary means of wealth accumulation for China’s middle class, real estate is rapidly losing its appeal among the younger generation, and experts say the change highlights how the nation’s rapid demographic shift has far-reaching implications.Patrick Lu, 32, a lawyer in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, is disinterested in investing in housing, unlike his parents who own a couple of two-bedroom apartments in the city.“In the past, a majority of Chinese people - those born between the 1960s and 1980s - invested most of their income in the real estate market. The stock of houses is huge,” said Lu, who is single and rents a flat with colleagues, close to their law firm. “But we no longer think like the older generation.“We don’t think the properties our parents leave us will be worth as much as they used to be, especially in lower-tier cities. That’s the reality, whether you accept it or not. There will be fewer young buyers.”Also read:Young Chinese put kids, marriage on back burner at record rate as cost pressures and COVID-19 overwhelmCommentary: The rise of China’s Gen Z will have massive consequences for business and politicsChina's 2022 property investment falls for first time since 1999The demographic changes in China will have “increasingly significant repercussions” on the country’s property market, as well as on the various social, economic and political sectors, and those repercussions will extend well beyond its shores, according to Joseph Chamie, a demographer and former director of the United Nations’ Population Division.“As has been the case in many other countries worldwide, the combination of demographic ageing and population decline typically translate into serious negative consequences for the property market,” Chamie explained.China’s population growth started to slow in 2016, and the total population fell by 850,000 last year, to 1.4118 billion, marking the first drop in six decades. Many demographers warn that the trend is irreversible, and they say that effective fertility support measures are critically important to stem the tide.The UN forecasts that China’s population will drop to 1.313 billion by 2050, and to below 800 million by 2100. The working-age population, aged 15 to 64, stood at 882.22 million last year, but this total is expected to be more than halved by the end of the century.The number of China’s young adults, aged 25 to 39, is forecast to fall from 325 million to 220 million by 2050.Related:Make it easier to raise children, say many in China after population fallsCommentary: China’s population decline - Chinese women make a strong case with a ‘birth strike’Commentary: Why China’s shrinking, ageing population is a big deal“It’s just 27 years away. That’s a fall of a third in the cohort of first-time property buyers,” said George Magnus, a research associate with Oxford University’s China Centre.“This means that, while people always want more space to live in, and housing demand can respond well for a short time to credit creation or deregulation, for example, the underlying trends in the first-time population and in new household formation are unequivocally bearish for the property sector,” Magnus said.The number of newly married couples also dropped for eight straight years to 2021, and the 7.64 million marriages that year were a record low dating back to the earliest available data in 1985, according to China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs. The peak came a decade ago, with almost 13.5 million marriages in 2013.China’s fertility rate has also plunged, from 2.6 births per woman in the late 1980s to 1.15 in 2021 - lower than 1.6 in the United States and 1.3 in Japan.“The declines in Chinese getting married at young ages and having children are coupled with the country’s declining and ageing population. China’s once ‘sizzling’ property sector will likely become China’s ‘chilling’ property sector. While that ‘chilling’ might not bring about a property market collapse, it could certainly become ‘cold’ for the property sector,” Chamie said.Li Feng, 37, who lives with her 75-year-old mother in the city of Suzhou located just west of Shanghai, has made it a priority this year to sell one of the two flats she owns.“I don’t think there will be enough demand supporting the bubbly property market,” said Li, a bank manager.“I’ll live alone after my mother passes away. There’s no need to keep a two-bedroom apartment,” Li said, explaining that she is single and has no intention of getting married or having kids.With around 1.8 million yuan (US$265,000) expected from the property sale, she plans to renovate the smaller flat, travel a bit each year and keep most of the rest in her savings account.“I don’t want to take the risk and worry about housing market fluctuations,” she said. “So, selling is the best option.”Chinese authorities have loosened the reins on property developers’ financing and have lifted restrictions on home purchases since last year, in a bid to prop up the beleaguered property sector amid fears of the devastating impact it could have on the already weakened economy.China’s economic tsar, Vice-Premier Liu He, has reiterated that the real estate sector is a pillar of the Chinese economy, as it accounts for 40 per cent of bank loans, half of local government revenue, and 60 per cent of Chinese household assets.But without solid economic growth and residential income, a recovery of the property market will be limited, and the deepening demographic crisis may also tarnish investor confidence.“While the property sector in China must shrink from its current oversized state, it would make a lot of sense if the income of the household sector were bolstered over time so that people could afford to upgrade housing space ... to compensate for other drags on demand. However, there is no sign that this is intended or desired,” Magnus said.Zheng Xiao, a 22-year-old university student in Shenzhen, said his parents, both of whom are private entrepreneurs, just sold a large 360sqm piece of housing for 18 million yuan in the city.“My parents spent several months to finally close the deal, with a price far lower than what they had expected,” Zheng said. “Young buyers don’t seem to be interested in large homes because they come with considerable stress in paying the high mortgages, with high property taxes but low usage for small families.”Magnus expects the property market to find some support this year after the amount of sold floor space plunged last year, but he ruled out a complete recovery in the sector.“I sense that the government must prevent a collapse, as such, in property because the middle class would be angry and badly affected - which is politically dangerous - but there’s no question that the sector will be materially smaller as a share of [gross domestic product] in the years to come. What takes its place is, as of yet, unclear,” he said.Generation Z believes that striking a work-life balance is more important than accumulating wealth, Zheng said.“Perhaps in the future we will see a lot of foreign labourers in China’s services market,” he said, noting how a similar situation has unfolded in Japan because of its ageing population.Meanwhile, much of the money that Chinese people have invested into homes could become unrecoverable. “Many houses will become sunk costs, deserted in places where there are fewer and fewer young people,” he predicted.This article was first published on SCMP.

REUTERS/Aly Song 13 Jan 2023 11:32AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING/SHANGHAI : China will boost financing for good quality property developers and roll out a 100 billion yuan ($14.86 billion) support plan for rental housing loans, the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday.Reporting the latest move to ease a liquidity crunch which has plagued the real estate sector since mid-2020, Xinhua said financial regulators have drafted a work plan to guide quality developers' balance sheet back to a safe range. The plan mainly targets high quality property firms with relatively big size and systemic importance, it said. Regulators will improve the ""three red lines"" rule for 30 pilot property firms, without giving specific names of the firms. The ""three red lines"" policy restricts the amount of new borrowing property developers can raise each year by placing caps on their debt ratios.Under the plan, authorities will encourage financial institutions to negotiate to extend debt to quality developers on a reasonable basis, it said.Authorities will also support developers' offshore debt repayment by providing policy support, including by helping to improve management of foreign exchange.The property sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of China's gross domestic product, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on growth.($1 = 6.7273 Chinese yuan renminbi) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

Average daily buyers' visits in the 50 cities monitored by the firm was 22 per cent higher in the first half of January than the previous month.The property sector, which accounts for a quarter of China's economy, was badly hit last year as many developers were unable to finish building projects that led to mortgage boycotts by some buyers. Lockdowns and movement measures to control the spread of COVID-19 also hurt buyer sentiment.The central bank last week said that for cities where the selling prices of new homes fall month-on-month and year-on-year for three consecutive months, the floor on mortgage rates can be lowered or abolished for first-time home buyers in phases.China is also planning to relax restrictions on borrowing for property developers by dialling back the ""three red lines"" policy unveiled in 2020 to tackle property developers' unbridled borrowing, Bloomberg News reported.A slew of property support measures for buyers and property developers in recent weeks, coupled with Beijing's abrupt reopening last month cheered the market, but continued sluggish demand still constrains the recovery.""The upward trend in market expectations is largely certain with both supply-side and demand-side policies being implemented,"" said the institute.""Demand that was suppressed by the COVID-19 is expected to release at an accelerated pace, and the real estate market in core cities likely to see an upturn in the first quarter of 2023.""

For cities where the selling prices of new homes fall month-on-month and year-on-year for three consecutive months, the floor on mortgage rates can be lowered or abolished for first-time home buyers in phases, according to a statement by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).In late September, the central bank had allowed localities to take similar action until the end of 2022.The move is more flexible than September's policy, said Chen Wenjing, analyst at China Index Academy, one of China's biggest real estate research firms, adding ""it will lower the cost of buying a home and help better support rigid and improved housing demand.""The crisis in China's property market, once a pillar of the world's second-biggest economy, worsened last summer with home prices, sales and investment all falling sharply.In recent weeks, policymakers have ramped up support for the industry to relieve a long-running liquidity squeeze that has hit developers and delayed the completion of many housing projects, scaring away buyers.According to analysts' calculation, 38 cities are eligible for adjustable mortgage rate floors, including some second-tier cities such as Wuhan and Zhengzhou and more than 20 smaller cities.Analysts said the move shows the government's growing intent to support demand in weak cities, but added the impact may be limited.""Lowering mortgage rates has not been able to drive sales. We think homebuyer confidence is a more important factor than affordability,"" said analysts at J.P.Morgan in a research note. Ni Hong, head of China's housing regulator, also vowed to give strong support to first-time homebuyers by allowing smaller down payments and cutting mortgage interest rates wherever appropriate, according to state broadcaster CCTV on Thursday.Ni said ""reasonable"" support needs to be given to buyers of second homes although not for the purchase of three homes or more, and he was confident the property market would stabilize and recover in 2023.

(Photo: AFP/STR) 04 Jan 2023 07:18PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn After a sweeping two-year crackdown on its debt-ridden property developers, China’s recent moves to shore up the sector are bringing some respite. But a slew of smaller builders are still struggling for survival.A case in point is Sichuan Languang Development, a builder of residential buildings and offices based in the southwestern city of Chengdu.Languang has slashed about 90 per cent of its workforce since early 2021 and reported an accrued loss of 11.7 billion yuan (US$1.7 billion) as of the third quarter last year.It has been selling off assets as it fights to stay afloat, and 27-year-old chairman Yang Wuzheng has approached dozens of larger real estate companies and other potential investors in search of a bailout - so far, without success.“Essentially, a lot of us are trying to win time,” Yang said. Currently his goal is simply to “hold our team together while exploring a way forward - whether that will be restructuring, strategic investment or a market turnaround”.Since mid-2020, policy makers have sought to reduce the risk of a property bubble with measures such as lending limits for banks and curbs to restrict borrowing by developers who fail to meet strict financial targets. For many small and mid-sized companies, these moves have been especially brutal.Also read:Troubled China Evergrande pledges to repay debts in 2023Commentary: Property crisis presents China with a dilemma“China’s property market is quite fragmented, so the smaller players are also crucial to the health of upstream and downstream sectors and economic growth,” said Zerlina Zeng, senior credit analyst at Creditsights Singapore.“Some regional players were key participants at local land sales, and thus are important to local governments’ fiscal conditions.”As lines of credit became increasingly difficult to access and home sales slumped in the shadow of COVID-19, many developers - industry giant China Evergrande Group included - were forced to miss repayments or to halt construction on some projects. Languang is among the companies that have had to do both. Like many Chinese property companies, it’s a family business. Growing up in Chengdu, Yang watched his father make the most of the country’s soaring property market, transforming Languang from a small auto-parts manufacturer into a real estate-focused conglomerate. Also read:Two Chinese property developers to raise funds via discounted share sales‘She got an abortion, broke up with me’: The human suffering behind China’s property crisisYang succeeded him as chairman in June 2021 - just weeks before the company defaulted on a debt payment.“After our default, we had around 100 housing projects that were stalled in over 70 cities,” said Yang, who seems years older than his true age and maintains his composure even when describing a crisis. “It was a deadlock, stakeholders want to cut their losses.” WIDESPREAD TURMOILLanguang’s shares have fallen by more than half since its default.And across the sector, the turmoil has been far-reaching: A Bloomberg gauge tracking Chinese developers’ stocks has fallen more than 40 per cent over the past two years while an index of high-yield dollar bonds dominated by builders had its second-worst year on record in 2022.Years of high leverage and high growth taught entrepreneurs like Yang’s father to bet big. His story - of a family rising from modest origins to substantial wealth on the back of the property boom - is common to many of his generation. But that route to prosperity seems to be closed.Now the Chinese government has lowered the systemic risk presented by the likes of Evergrande, it is stepping up efforts to calm the property sector’s turmoil.In November, it rolled out a 16-point plan to ease liquidity issues in the sector and last month hinted there would be more support to come. Traders piled back into the sector, causing the stock gauge to surge more than 50 per cent over the past two months.The government’s priorities are ensuring that unfinished homes are completed, after a spate of protests last year, and supporting high-quality developers. But more embattled businesses will need to lift themselves up even as China’s economic growth slows and consumer sentiment remains weak in the wake of zero-COVID.“We are still struggling to survive but there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Yang said. “For the sector, I think a policy trough has come. The future will be about working with relevant authorities to seek some rescue.”WAY FORWARDYang describes feeling overwhelmed by his company’s challenges. Of the thousands of staff to leave Languang, many have abandoned the property industry altogether. Some have opened restaurants or become ride-sharing drivers, while others are retraining or remain unemployed.The departures included several senior managers, some of whom have succumbed to depression. To control costs, little things now matter. Documents are printed on both sides, offices are only air-conditioned part of the time and lavish banquets with creditors - a common feature of doing business in China - have become a rarity. Still, Yang says the company has restarted more than 90 per cent of its stalled housing projects with the help of local government mediation. City officials brought various stakeholders to the table to negotiate how to complete the work. For instance, builders must finish one floor of a given building before they get paid; they only start work on the next floor once payment has been received. The developer has about 400 active projects in total.Related:China Evergrande resumes work on pre-sold projectsChina Fortune Land sells property units to CR Land in debt restructuring Yang sees Languang’s best way forward as a complete restructuring.“If we stay in the property sector, the path forward will be building a boutique shop pursuing quality growth,” he added. But if Languang succeeds in finding a strategic investor, “we may switch our business according to their needs”.“The old days are not coming back and rightfully so,” he said. He believes the property bubble would have burst eventually even without the government’s deleveraging campaign. Evergrande, the highest-profile casualty of the crisis, has vowed to repay debt in 2023 after repeatedly delaying its much-anticipated restructuring plan.And more consolidation in the sector seems likely, according to Chi Lo, senior investment strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management Asia, “as weak developers exit the market and state-owned developers play a bigger role”. In the longer term, China’s property sector will remain important but “play a smaller role in driving the nation’s GDP growth as it abandons quantity growth for quality growth”, he said.

The moves have included lifting a ban on fundraising via equity offerings for listed property firms.The property sector has also got a slight boost after Beijing abruptly dropped its strict zero-COVID policy in early December, which could lure consumers back to showrooms. But the virus is now spreading largely unchecked and likely infecting millions of people a day, according to some international health experts. ""Real estate policies may continue to maintain an accommodative tone with room for policy easing on the supply and demand side in 2023,"" said the real estate research firm, adding ""the housing market is expected to stabilize gradually next year.""

REUTERS/Aly Song 29 Nov 2022 09:40AM (Updated: 29 Nov 2022 09:50PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG/SHANGHAI :Chinese property developers' shares and bonds soared on Tuesday after regulators lifted a ban on equity refinancing for listed firms, the latest support measure for a cash-squeezed sector that has been a key pillar of the world's No. 2 economy.The move will make it easier for developers to obtain fresh funding, analysts said, but reviving demand from homebuyers would remain challenging amid persisting COVID-19 curbs that have triggered rare street protests across many Chinese cities.The shares and bonds surged after China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Monday it would broaden equity financing channels, including private share placements for China and Hong Kong-listed developers, lifting a ban in place for years.The move is the latest regulatory easing as Beijing steps up support for the property business, a sector that accounts for a quarter of the Chinese economy. Many developers have defaulted on debt obligations and have now halted construction.Hubei Fuxing Science and Technology Co said late on Tuesday it plans to launch a private placement of shares to fund real estate development, becoming the first China-listed developer to announce such a move after lifting of the ban.The company will target 35 investors in the share sale, which will not exceed 30 per cent of the current capital base, it said in an exchange filing. That size is worth as much as 1.37 billion yuan ($191 million) as per its current market value.China's CSI 300 Real Estate Index closed up 9.4 per cent, marking its biggest daily jump ever.Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index closed 8.1 per cent higher. Shares of Longfor, Agile and China Vanke jumped between 8 per cent and 14 per cent, while Country Garden added 4.5 per cent. Nomura analysts said they believed sentiment towards the property development sector ""should see notable lift due to the continued introduction of policy easing by the central government in the past one month.""They added, however, after the latest change, policy easing on the supply side has been ""more or less exhausted"", and the central government will have to find ways to boost demand for property.Reviving property demand would be challenging under the ""the recent worsening COVID-19 situation and protests in major Chinese cities, as well as the weakening housing price trends"", the Nomura analysts wrote.Street protests erupted in cities across China over the weekend, which analysts described as a vote against President Xi Jinping's zero-COVID policy and the country's strongest show of public defiance during his political career.YUAN BONDS ROCKETDespite the uncertain demand outlook, investors cheered the latest funding support measures.Yuan-denominated bonds issued by Chinese developers CIFI Group, Shanghai Shimao Co, Guangzhou Times Holdings, Country Garden rocketed between 20 per cent and 40 per cent each on Tuesday.Dollar bonds also traded up, though gains were milder. A tranche of Country Garden's dollar bonds due to mature by January 2025 added 5.6 cents.Shares in Chinese investment banks also moved higher on hopes that the latest equity financing relaxation will potentially boost their share underwriting business. Citic Securities edged up by 3.4 per cent in Hong Kong.On investor appetite for share offerings by developers, a Hong Kong-based capital markets banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said more investors would gradually look at those stocks given the ""attractive valuations"".""Most of the funding channels the property developers need are covered now,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. He said lifting the equity financing ban was a major move, after Beijing expanded a financing programme to support bond issuance.""It is now up to whether the market, or basically the state players will actually support the sector,"" he said. If funds could be raised from state-backed investors, there will be meaningful consolidation in the property sector, Ng said.Analysts from China International Capital Corp said listed developers were likely to receive ""sustained benefit"".""Good quality developers will improve their operational cash flows and balance sheets... while some financially weaker developers might be acquired or merged,"" they said.POSITIVE SUPPORT Beijing suspended refinancing by listed property firms in August 2009 as part of its attempts to control surging home prices. Regulators briefly lifted the suspension by granting approval to refinancing requests by a selection of property firms starting from 2013, but reimposed restrictions in 2016 to curb housing prices.As per the CSRC's guidelines issued on Monday, eligible listed developers will be allowed to issue shares to buy property-related assets, replenish working capital or repay debts. Listed developers can also now seek regulatory approval for merger and acquisitions, and access related financing.Citigroup analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday that the lifting of the ban on equity refinancing was ""another significant positive support"" for the sector's liquidity and facilitates the introduction of new strategic investors.

REUTERS/Jason Lee 25 Nov 2022 03:24PM (Updated: 25 Nov 2022 05:12PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG/SHANGHAI: China's central bank will offer cheap loans to financial firms for buying bonds issued by property developers, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said, the strongest policy support yet for the crisis-hit sector.The People's Bank of China (PBOC) hopes the loans will boost market sentiment toward the heavily indebted property sector, which has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past year, and rescue a number of private developers, said the people, who asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.China has stepped up support in recent weeks for the property sector, a pillar accounting for a quarter of the world's second-biggest economy. Many developers defaulted on their debt obligations and were forced to halt construction.The country's biggest banks this week pledged at least US$162 billion in credit to developers.The PBOC loans, through its relending facility, are expected to be at much lower than the benchmark interest rate and would be implemented in the coming weeks, giving financial institutions more incentive to invest in private developers' onshore bonds, two sources said.Terms such as the interest rate on the loans were not immediately known.The PBOC is also drafting a ""white list"" of good-quality and systemically important developers that would receive wider support from Beijing to improve their balance sheets, two of the sources said.The central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned measures.At least three private developers - including Longfor Group Holdings, Midea Real Estate Holding and Seazen Holdings - received the green light this month to raise a total of 50 billion yuan (US$7 billion) in debt. If there were not enough demand from investors for such new bonds, the PBOC would likely step in to provide liquidity via the relending facility for the rest of the issuance, said one of the four people and another source.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index was up as much as 4.7 per cent on Friday (Nov 25), adding 1 per centage point after Reuters reported the PBOC moves. China's top developer by sales, Country Garden, was up 10 per cent, CIFI Holdings was up more than 5 per cent and Longfor nearly 4 per cent.FROM CRACKDOWN TO AGGRESSIVE SUPPORTRelending is a targeted policy tool the PBOC typically uses to make low-cost loans to banks to support the slowing economy, as the central bank faces limited room to cut interest rates on concerns about capital flight.The PBOC in recent months has used the relending facility to support sectors including transport, logistics and tech innovation that were hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic or are favoured by long-term state policies.Beijing's aggressive support for the property sector marks a reversal from a crackdown begun in 2020 on speculators and indebted developers in a broad push to reduce financial risks.As a result of the crackdown, though, property sales and prices fell, developers defaulted on bonds and suspended construction. The construction halts have angered homeowners who have threatened to stop mortgage payments.The PBOC also plans to provide 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion) in M&A financing facilities to state-owned asset managers mainly for their acquisitions of real estate projects from troubled developers, two sources said.Chinese media reported on Monday the central bank planned to provide 200 billion yuan in interest-free relending loans to commercial banks through the end of March for housing completions.Among other recent official support, China's interbank bond market regulator said this month it would widen a programme to support about 250 billion yuan ($35 billion) of debt offerings by private firms.Much of Beijing's previous support targeted state-owned developers.Yi Huiman, chairman of China's securities regulator, said on Monday the country must implement plans to improve the balance sheets of ""good quality"" developers.Fitch Ratings said on Thursday private Chinese developers face higher liquidity risk, in terms of debt structure with greater short-term maturity pressure, than state-owned peers as banks and other creditors are becoming reluctant to lend.Related:‘She got an abortion, broke up with me’: The human suffering behind China’s property crisisIn China's property crisis, global asset managers see opportunity in rental housing Source: Reuters/cm Related Topics China bank Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Stringer 23 Nov 2022 12:11PM (Updated: 23 Nov 2022 08:09PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING: Three of China's biggest commercial banks have agreed to provide fundraising support to property developers, including industry giant Vanke, in a coordinated effort to support the country's embattled property sector.It marks one of the latest moves by state-owned banks to respond to Beijing's call to ease pressure on debt-laden developers and reverse a housing slump.The property sector makes up about a quarter of China's economy.Bank of Communications (BoCom) said it agreed to provide a 100 billion yuan (US$13.98 billion) line of credit to Vanke and a 20 billion yuan line of credit to Midea Real Estate Holding, two separate statements issued by the bank said on Wednesday (Nov 23).Under the agreements, BoCom will be likely to offer the two developers property development loans, loans for M&A deals and bond investments.The agreement is part of BoCom's efforts to implement 16 measures outlined by Chinese regulators that aim to boost liquidity in the property sector, the bank said in the statements.""BoCom will continue to fulfill the responsibility of a state-owned bank, (and) accurately promote high-quality economic development with high-quality financial services,"" it said.Also on Wednesday, Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) said it has signed strategic agreements to provide fundraising support to five property companies, including Vanke, Longfor Group Holdings and China Resources Land. The bank did not give further details on the scale of the support.Bank of China also said on Wednesday it agreed to provide a line of credit of up to 100 billion yuan to Vanke.Vanke is the country's second-largest developer by sales.China's property sector, once a pillar of growth, has slowed sharply this year due to government efforts to restrict excessive borrowing by developers.The clampdown has triggered falls in property investment, sales and prices, and a growing number of bond defaults. Construction of many housing projects has stalled, scaring away potential home buyers.Chinese authorities have announced a flurry of fiscal measures recently to ease the developers' liquidity crisis.In the latest policy move, China's central bank will provide 200 billion yuan in loans to six commercial banks for housing completions, according to a deputy central bank official quoted by the state-run Economic Daily on Monday.In response to Beijing's policy guidance, more banks are expected to sign agreements with developers to increase real estate loan issuance, said Liu Shui, an analyst at China Index Academy.Many analysts, however, believe the property market will take a long time to recover.""(A) broad recovery in new-home sales remains the key for a sustained improvement in developers' liquidity profiles,"" a Fitch Ratings report said on Wednesday.""We expect no material improvement in the operating environment, as homebuyers' confidence remains fragile amid weak economic prospects and uncertainty surrounding delivery of pre-sold properties,"" the Fitch report said.

A recent slew of support measures, including loan repayment extensions, aimed at improving liquidity in the property sector has underpinned market sentiment.($1 = 7.1665 Chinese yuan renminbi) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

But prices were expected to rise 1.0 per cent for the full year.""For 2023, property indexes are expected to see a turning point and consumer confidence will improve with the economy completely stabilised after COVID restrictions ease,"" said Li Zongguang, chief economist at China Renaissance Holdings Limited.""Property measures are expected to strengthen support, which will improve residents' confidence.""Woes in China's real estate market, which accounts for about a quarter of its $17 trillion economy, deepened in October, weighed down by COVID-19 curbs and industry-wide problems. New home prices fell at their fastest pace in over seven years in October and sales slumped for the 15th straight month.A recent slew of support measures, including loan repayment extensions, aimed at improving liquidity in the property sector has underpinned market sentiment.But analysts and economists in the poll expected concerns about falling house prices, protracted COVID restrictions, and delays in construction to continue to weigh on demand.Property sales were seen slumping 5.0 per cent in the first half of 2023, a smaller drop than the 15.0 per cent fall forecast in the September poll. Economists expected a 1.0 per cent slump in sales for the whole of 2023, the survey showed.Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, expected the market to gradually stabilise as the financing measures boosted confidence, but she did not expect a V-shaped rebound, stressing the need for more policies targeting demand.""More home purchase support policy is needed,"" especially a move to ease some home purchase curbs in major cities, Huang added.Demand for property took a big hit this past year as many developers lurched from crisis to crisis and halted the construction of apartments as they ran out of money. Beijing last week eased some of its COVID curbs with officials flagging further fine-tuning of restrictions, raising hopes of a complete reopening after annul parliamentary meetings in the spring of 2023.Some analysts say average house prices will need to fall by around 20 per cent to 30 per cent to entice demand.(This story has been refiled to correct home prices to rise 1.0 per cent in 2023, not 1.8 per cent)(For other stories from the Reuters quarterly housing market polls:) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

(File photo: Reuters/Aly Song) 10 Oct 2023 08:24AM (Updated: 10 Oct 2023 08:13PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: Country Garden warned on Tuesday (Oct 10) about its inability to meet offshore debt obligations, potentially joining a growing list of Chinese developers that have defaulted and setting the stage for one of the country's biggest debt restructurings.Companies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales - mostly private property developers - have defaulted on debt obligations since a liquidity crisis hit the sector in 2021, leaving many homes unfinished.Country Garden, China's largest private property developer, has not defaulted so far, but has missed coupon payments on some dollar bonds since last month and faces the end of 30-day grace periods for making payments from next week.In a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, Country Garden said that its sales and financing were facing ""significant challenges"", and its available funds have continued to decrease.The company said it would ""not be able to meet all of its offshore payment obligations when due or within the relevant grace periods"", adding non-payment may lead to creditors demanding payment acceleration or pursuing enforcement action.Country Garden's warning underscores how an unprecedented liquidity squeeze in the Chinese property sector, accounting for roughly a quarter of the economy, and weaker sales continue to darken prospects for developers.Beijing has rolled out a raft of measures in recent months, including reducing deposit requirements and cutting existing mortgage rates, to help renew homebuyers' confidence, but growing debt woes of developers was unlikely to help achieve that goal.Country Garden, which has US$10.96 billion of offshore bonds and 42.7 billion yuan (US$5.86 billion) worth of offshore loans, said it was facing ""significant"" uncertainty regarding the disposal of assets and its cash position remained under pressure.The developer said it had appointed Houlihan Lokey, China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and law firm Sidley Austin as advisers to examine its capital structure and liquidity position and formulate a holistic solution.The company added it will work with advisers to develop the most pragmatic and optimal solution for all stakeholders, and called for patience from creditors.Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang said mandating advisers showed ""whether the company will default hinges on the outcome of overseas debt restructuring and the next two weeks will be crucial.""""We do not expect Country Garden's liquidity to materially improve as homebuyers and financial institutions may continue to stay on the sidelines.""BIG TEST LOOMSChina's latest property sector slump started in 2021 after a government-led crackdown on a debt-fuelled building boom. It has deepened as economic growth faltered and confidence in housing and capital markets dried up, further squeezing developers' liquidity.Country Garden was due on Monday to pay US$66.8 million in coupons on 2024 and 2026 dollar bonds, although the payments have a 30-day grace period. The developer has not disclosed whether those payments were made.The developer did not make a principal payment of HK$470 million (US$60.04 million) on certain debts, it said in Tuesday's filing, without providing further details.Country Garden faces a big test next week when its entire offshore debt could be deemed in default if it fails to pay a US$15 million September coupon by Oct 17, at the end of the 30-day grace period.It has, however, won approval from onshore bondholders for the extension of nine series of bonds with an outstanding principal value of 14.7 billion yuan (US$2.02 billion), the filing said.The extension has provided it ""with the time and space to focus on the recovery of its business operations,"" it added.Related:Chinese developer Country Garden faces fresh offshore payments deadlineCash-squeezed developer Country Garden faces another dollar coupon deadline Default dodged, but Country Garden's upcoming debt payments stir worries: AnalysisLIQUIDATION PETITIONSCountry Garden's shares extended losses on Tuesday to drop more than 10% by the afternoon, having lost nearly 70% of their value since the start of the year.""The company's previous model was not sustainable, they are now addressing it, trying to scale down their debt burden and make their business size appropriate,"" said Sandra Chow, CreditSight's co-head of Asia Pacific research.""There is a smaller property market overall and it makes sense to adapt to that,"" she said, adding that a restructuring would look to extend debt maturity repayments, reduce bond coupon rates and accelerate asset sales.Country Garden said it would make ""its best effort to ensure the delivery of properties, which is the group's most critical corporate responsibility and is the key pillar to safeguard the property market.""Many defaulted developers, including China Evergrande Group, which is at the centre of the debt crisis, are facing liquidation petitions. So far, only a couple have been ordered to wind up by overseas courts.Smaller peer Kaisa Group said creditors would get less than 5 per cent of their money back if it is forced into liquidation, a lawyer for one creditor, Broad Peak Investment, who has filed a winding up petition against the developer, told a Hong Kong court on Tuesday.

If it defaults, these debts will need to be restructured, and the company or its assets also risk liquidation by creditors.China's property sector has been hit by a debt crisis since 2021.

Policy momentum since August end has exceeded expectations, Citi economists said in a note, citing a cut in personal incometax, as property prices ease in Tier-1 cities and home loans get repriced. The brokerage expects retail sales to improve and industrial production to hold steady following a rebound in factory activity.The upbeat view is a shift from its previous stance in August where it cited disappointing policy support and worries of contagion from the property crisis to cut its forecast for full-year growth to 4.7 per cent.""Further policy measures could be announced such as product-specific consumption support and further relaxation of administrative controls in the housing market,"" JPM economist Haibin Zhu said.""We would also watch out for a policy scheme (debt swap or debt restructuring) to deal with local government hidden debt.""Zhu said policy measures to support the surviving private developers could also be introduced.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo 05 Oct 2023 01:01PM (Updated: 05 Oct 2023 01:22PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG : As developer China Evergrande Group lurched from one crisis to another over the past two years, Beijing avoided directly intervening to rescue what was not too long ago considered one of the country's ""too big to fail"" enterprises.With the world's most indebted developer now standing at the precipice after authorities launched a criminal investigation into its billionaire founder, some creditors, investors and analysts are now betting on authorities stepping in to manage the fallout.A messy collapse of the property giant could rip through the already-sputtering economy, with hundreds of thousands of unfinished homes across the country and roughly $300 billion worth of liabilities at home in China alone.Despite a growing number of Chinese property developers having defaulted on debt obligations since a liquidity crisis hit the sector in 2021, Beijing has not directly stepped in to bail out any firm so far.The prospects of Evergrande's offshore debt restructuring plan, key to its survival, as well as its overall business have been clouded by the criminal investigation into founder and chairman Hui Ka Yan.The probe suggests debt revamp efforts led by Hui have been rejected by the central government, which will now step in to take control and formulate new plans, said Xin Sun, senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian Business at King's College London.""The (investigation into Hui) clearly shows that Chinese policymakers prioritise political considerations to economic ones in dealing with Evergrande,"" he said. ""From a political perspective, the government needs to ensure the company and its owners paying a heavy price for causing China's real estate crisis and facing due punishment. Any restructuring can only happen after this political responsibility being taken.""Evergrande has contract liabilities - payments made in advance from homebuyers - of 604 billion yuan ($83 billion), which is equivalent to around 600,000 housing units, according to a Gavekal Dragonomics report. Beijing has made the completion and delivery of homes a top priority after the proliferation of unfinished apartments across the country sparked unprecedented collective disobedience in June last year.""The government's priority will clearly be to deliver unsold and unfinished housing to homebuyers,"" said Christopher Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics, referring to the Evergrande situation.""You don't need a formal government takeover, or even a SOE white-knight investor, for the government to start exerting massive influence over the company's decisions, or for the entire industry to become more state-owned."" Evergrande and China's housing authority did not immediately respond to requests for comment during the week long National Day holiday. EVERGRANDE RESTRUCTURINGEven before the probe into Hui was made public, Evergrande's debt restructuring plan was clouded by its disclosure that it was unable to issue new debt due to an investigation into its main China unit.Late last month, it also said it would have to reassess the terms of the proposed restructuring as home sales were not meeting expectations.""For all of the restructuring ... issuance of new notes to an extension is a core part, so I don't know how you can get it done without that,"" said Sandra Chow, co-head of Asia-Pacific research at CreditSights.Gavekal in its report said that at the very least, an orderly restructuring of Evergrande seemed increasingly hard to achieve. A liquidation petition filed against Evergrande is scheduled for hearing in a Hong Kong court on Oct 30.A person close to Evergrande, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the debt restructuring would be delayed but could still go ahead with guidance from a government-appointed risk management committee.As the liquidity crisis snowballed at Evergrande in 2021, a risk-management committee was established at the company in December which included officials from state companies to assist in its debt and asset restructuring.An Evergrande bondholder, who also declined to be named, however, said restructuring efforts were set to be derailed by the Hui investigation and the developer could be liquidated even after government intervention.But there is no clarity on how potentially one of the biggest liquidation exercises globally will play out and what will happen to creditors, especially offshore, as well as suppliers and homebuyers awaiting delivery of apartments.Of its total liabilities worth $327 billion at the end of June, Evergrande has been in the process of seeking creditors' approval for restructuring offshore debt worth $31.7 billion, which includes bonds, collateral, and repurchase obligations.Because of the massive debt pile, worsening cash flow, and the scale of unfinished homes, some analysts wonder whether Evergrande has now morphed from too-big-to-fail to too-complicated-to-exist.""Evergrande is large enough that its collapse needs to be managed. Partly because of size, (and) partly because of managing expectations,"" said Antonio Fatas, INSEAD professor of economics.In China, ""because of the political/economic system and because of the large interference of the government and state-owned enterprises...there will always be a political question on how to share the losses associated with events like this one.""($1 = 7.3010 Chinese yuan renminbi) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

(Photo: STR / AFP)Growth prospects hampered by weakened confidence, debt burdens as property market continues slouchRecent policy shifts have helped, but full-scale turnaround unlikely as decision makers are still charting long-term course South China Morning Post South China Morning Post 05 Oct 2023 10:24AM (Updated: 05 Oct 2023 10:26AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn China’s property crisis is expected to continue to slow its growth. The World Bank said on Sunday (Oct 1) it had cut its 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimates for the world’s second-largest economy to 4.4 per cent, down from its previous 4.8 per cent.The bank cited elevated debt and weakness in the property sector as key drivers for this change, as well as longer-term structural factors.HOW HAS THE PROPERTY DOWNTURN AFFECTED THE ECONOMY?China’s GDP growth has been largely driven by investment in infrastructure and property, although years of rapid growth has left these sectors saddled with mountains of debt.China’s aggregate domestic non-financial debt-to-GDP ratio has more than doubled according to the World Bank, from 132 per cent in 2007 to 285 per cent in 2023.Following intense efforts from Chinese regulators to deleverage and reform the real estate sector, private developers began to default on their debt in the middle of 2021, leading to many unfinished homes and suppliers and creditors with unpaid accounts.Besides contributing to around a third of China’s GDP, property accounts for 65 per cent of total household assets.Housing prices in less developed cities have fallen more than 20 per cent since 2021, affecting already weak consumer and business confidence.WILL THE PROPERTY CRISIS HAVE SYSTEMIC EFFECTS?Chinese lending to property developers is relatively small – just over 5 per cent of onshore banks’ total loan book, according to Oxford Economics. However, smaller regional banks’ non-performing loans ratios could worsen due to a higher level of exposure to the real estate sector as well as local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).LGFVs are hybrid entities that are both public and corporate and were created to skirt restrictions on local government borrowing. They have proliferated since the global financial crisis in 2008.Related:CNA Explains: With another Chinese property giant in crisis, how worried should the world be? 'Too afraid to buy': China's slowing economy overshadows property easing moves China’s economic data shows signs of life amid prevailing doom-and-gloom outlookLocal governments used their LGFVs to boost transactions in the land market last year to make up for a fall in purchases by property developers.This prompted the Ministry of Finance to issue a statement instructing regional authorities to stop the practice, but the effort was not altogether effective. LGFVs still accounted for half of land purchases in 2022, compared to 33 per cent in 2021 and 17 per cent in 2020, according to Rhodium Group.Given growing concerns over the default risk LGFV debt presents, the central government has said it was necessary to resolve the issue with “a comprehensive solution”.HAVE POLICYMAKERS SIGNALLED A U-TURN?President Xi Jinping’s “housing is for living in, not for speculation” comment has been the guiding principle for containing the overheating property market since 2016 and has been repeatedly referenced in statements from various meetings of the Politburo, the top decision-making body of the Communist Party.But the phrase was dropped in the statement released after the Politburo meeting in July. Instead, the Politburo said it was necessary to adapt to “major changes” in the demand-supply dynamics of the property market, with city-specific measures to better meet residents’ needs for better housing. It also pledged to “revitalise all types of idling properties”.Since August, policymakers have introduced a series of easing measures. Although none was decisive enough to turn the market around, there are small signs of stabilisation in home sales for some large cities.UBS’s chief China economist Wang Tao said the easing measures so far reflect “a lack of consensus and coordination within the government on the right scale of support to the property sector”.Related:Commentary: Why China’s real estate crisis should make the global travel industry nervousChina's property slump worsens, clouding recovery prospectsEven China's 1.4 billion population can't fill all its vacant homes, former official saysWILL THE PROPERTY SECTOR REMAIN INTEGRAL?Weakening property and land markets have widened domestic fiscal deficits, which may limit China’s future investment and GDP growth.The long-term prospects of the sector may also be hampered by a decline in population, slowing urbanisation, already high rates of home ownership and shadow inventory – properties that are not occupied but have not yet been put on the market.Li Daokui, professor of economics at Tsinghua University and a former adviser to the Chinese central bank, said he believes the “golden period” of the real estate market is over, but it will still be an “important pillar of the national economy in the future”.“After all, only 65 per cent of China’s population lives in cities, and at least 20 per cent of them do not own their own houses. The real estate market is still important,” Li said in an interview with Baidu News last month.Yao Yang, dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said real estate will always be a “sunrise industry”.“The current downturn is only temporary and is the result of using short-term policies to address long-term goals,” Yao said in an interview with Baidu News in August. “If policy adjustments are made in a timely manner, expectations and confidence will be restored.”This article was first published on SCMP.

""Housing prices and rents have risen a lot compared to the past, but in the end, salaries haven't gone up that much.""After weathering decades of deflation and stagnant growth, Japan is seeing an investment boom that has made apartments in central Tokyo unaffordable for young Japanese professionals.The flood of investment drove the average price for a new condominium in central Tokyo up 60 per cent to a record 129.6 million yen (US$865,000) in the first half of this year, according to the Real Estate Economic Institute.For locals, the surge in prices has made Tokyo the second most unaffordable city worldwide, only behind Hong Kong, according to a UBS global real estate report.A 60 sq m apartment in Tokyo now costs 15 times a skilled worker's salary, up from 10 times a decade ago and well above London, Singapore and New York, the UBS report showed.While partly due to low-interest rates, the price surge is being driven by foreign buyers taking advantage of the weak yen, now near a 33-year low, and those looking to shift funds out of China, where a real estate crisis and geopolitical concerns are putting a chill on investment, according to property experts.Related:China's property slump worsens, clouding recovery prospectsJapanese homeowners face an unfamiliar headache: higher mortgagesForeigners have piled more than 1.8 trillion yen into Japanese real estate since 2019, outstripping flows from institutional investors, property funds, and corporations, according to consultancy Cushman & Wakefield.And there is more to come. Funds from property speculators have piled up over the pandemic, and Japan looks to be a prime destination in Asia for it to land, said Cushman & Wakefield director Mari Kumagai.""If they want to keep the money in Asia Pacific, it tends to be either Australia or Singapore or Japan,"" Kumagai said, adding that Japan was the most attractive of the three, based on value stability and size of the economy.Average condo prices in central Tokyo were bumped up in the past year by a large supply of high-end residences hitting the market. Emblematic of that is the new Azabudai Hills complex, featuring the country's largest office tower and about 1,400 residential units.The Azabudai project, which looms over the iconic Tokyo Tower, is catching the attention of investors in Taiwan, said Wang Mao San, president of Shingi-fusaya Realty.Super wealthy Taiwanese are snapping up Tokyo properties worth more than 100 million yen for second homes, he said, while regular rich investors focus on condos in the 30 million to 70 million yen range in Tokyo and the western metropolis of Osaka.""In Japan, the political and economical situation is stable,"" Wang said about the attractiveness of the market. ""Tokyo is still not that expensive compared to other big cities like Hong Kong and London.""A luxury condo in Tokyo's high-end Motoazabu area is priced at less than half that of Hong Kong and 45 per cent cheaper than London, according to the Japan Real Estate Institute data.That's cold comfort for Mari Mochizuki, a single mother and salesperson for a music company who's been hunting in vain for an apartment big enough for her piano and perhaps the addition of a cat.The 39-year-old is eager to find a place that will hold its resale value in case she has to move for work. But the options she's seen in the city centre are either too pricey or worn out, pushing her search area to the northern edges of the capital.""It seems like prices for every apartment of decent size are blindly going up, even those out-of-the-way areas or with surprisingly cheap interiors,"" she said.

The world's most indebted developer later said in a statement that Hui was being investigated.Chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities Linus Yip said: ""The trading resumption may have fuelled speculation that there may be progress in restructuring.""""Looks like the gains are driven by speculative money,"" Willer Chen, a senior research analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia, told Bloomberg. ""With this volatility, I really don't know if there's any chance for any proper investor to make money on this name.The once top-selling Chinese developer has been embroiled in a debt crisis that reached a turning point when it defaulted on its offshore debt obligations in late 2021, sending jitters through global markets amid fears of contagion.The crisis deepened last week when it said its main unit in China was unable to issue new debt due to an ongoing investigation, further complicating the developer's restructuring plan.The clock is ticking for Evergrande to get creditors' approval for restructuring its offshore debt.Reuters reported last Tuesday that a major Evergrande offshore creditor group was planning to join a liquidation court petition filed against the developer if it does not submit a new debt revamp plan by the end of October.With the latest setbacks, some analysts say the debt restructuring plan now looks set to falter and that the risks of the company being liquidated are increasing.The developer is scheduled to have a hearing on a winding up petition on October 30.Evergrande estimated it had debts of US$328 billion at the end of June.Related:China Evergrande chairman under scrutiny on suspicion of crimesEvergrande shares halted as concerns mount about developer's prospectChina Evergrande's billionaire boss Hui Ka Yan goes from power circles to police surveillance The firm said it was ""necessary to reassess the terms"" of the plan in order to suit the ""objective situation and the demand of the creditors"".Its property arm missed a key bond payment last week, and Chinese financial website Caixin reported that former executives had been detained.Given the changing status of the Evergrande crisis and the property market contributing to one-third of the country's economic activity, SPI Asset Management's Stephen Innes said he could not ""see China sitting back and watching the real estate market crumble"".""This extensive reliance on the property sector raises concerns about its potential impact on various related industries, ranging from construction materials like steel and cement to household appliances and other consumer goods,"" he told AFP.""Any disruptions or downturns in the property market can have far-reaching consequences for these allied industries.""VANISHED LIFE SAVINGSChina's property sector has long been a pillar of growth - along with construction it accounts for about a quarter of GDP - and it experienced a dazzling boom in recent decades.However, the massive debt accrued by its biggest players has been seen by Beijing as an unacceptable risk for China's financial system and overall economic health.Authorities have gradually tightened developers' access to credit since 2020, and a wave of defaults has followed - notably that of Evergrande.The long-running housing crisis has wreaked misery on the lives of homebuyers across the country, who have often staked life savings on properties that never materialised.A wave of mortgage boycotts spread nationwide last summer, as cash-strapped developers struggled to raise enough to complete homes they had already sold in advance - a common practice in China.Policymakers have come under intense pressure in recent months to unveil measures to support the economy, particularly the property sector.But they are not keen on the type of bonanza unveiled in 2008 during the financial crisis, meaning the government could struggle to hit its growth target of around 5 per cent for this year. That would represent one of its worst performances in decades, excluding during the pandemic.

(Photo: AFP/Anthony Wallace) South China Morning Post South China Morning Post 02 Oct 2023 01:51PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: What can Hong Kong do to get its mojo back? That is the question on everyone’s lips, particularly as the city’s international comeback has so far fallen short of the assertion that Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu made late last year when the city was close to reopening - “Hong Kong always bounces back, better than ever”.It is true that the subsequent blitz to woo tourists and business talent has worked to some extent. Visitor arrivals in August reached 4.1 million, or 84 per cent of pre-pandemic levels for that month.But pessimism looms over the city’s future, particularly among international businesses and investors in the wake of the 2019 unrest and the 2020 imposition of the national security law, whose broad scope has raised genuine concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s judiciary independence.The city’s home prices fell for the fourth straight month in August, about 15 per cent down from a peak in September 2021.The average daily trading turnover on Hong Kong’s stock exchange has remained just over HK$100 billion (US$12.8 billion). On Sep 27, the total trading turnover even fell below HK$80 billion.The Hong Kong government is under mounting pressure to remove property market curbs to stop the rot and has set up a task force to review stock market liquidity.But working on short-term solutions is not enough to restore confidence and enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a global financial centre. As Lee puts the finishing touches on his much-heralded policy address later this month, he must be bold and creative in drawing up an action plan to bring back Hong Kong’s can-do spirit and get people excited again about this great city.First and foremost, he must display the determination and courage to fix the housing problem, a major source of discontent in the city boasting the least affordable homes in the world.HONG KONG SHOULD LEARN FROM BEIJINGSoon after I first came to Hong Kong in 1993, I read about the “cage homes” where the poor and downtrodden slept in bunk beds surrounded by wire cages.Three decades later, these homes still exist, but are now called “bedspace apartments”, and licensed by the government. There are an estimated 5,000 “cage” residents, down from 53,200 in 2007. But more broadly, 220,000 people still live in cramped conditions, in subdivided units.In these 30 years, I have read so many reports about the city’s political and business elite lamenting the lack of easy solutions. Ironically, although some of these individuals have been looking to Beijing for guidance in the past few years, they have failed to learn anything meaningful.In fact, to resolve the housing crisis, Hong Kong can and should learn from Beijing.In 2015, when President Xi Jinping vowed the mainland would eradicate absolute poverty by the end of 2020, about 70 million people lived under the poverty line. As Xi took personal responsibility for the project, hundreds of thousands were mobilised to speak to impoverished households across the country, and start files detailing their needs and how to help them.In February 2021, Xi announced a sweeping victory, with 99 million people lifted out of absolute poverty after eight years.In contrast, I bet the Hong Kong government doesn’t have an accurate tally of the numbers of people living in cage homes and subdivided flats around the city, let alone their needs and the causes of their hardship.Xi has urged Hong Kong to solve the housing problem and Xia Baolong, the top official in charge of Hong Kong, even challenged the city to get rid of cage homes and subdivided flats by 2049. But Hong Kong can’t really afford to wait that long.Is Lee bold enough to bring that deadline forward to 2032, or the end of his prospective second term?That means that Lee must take up the reins personally, adopt a whole-of-government approach, and draw up not only a new housing policy but also a holistic plan to help the city’s poor and downtrodden. It will be a tough fight but not impossible, with the full support of the Hong Kong public and the central government.Related:Commentary: Hong Kong property - when a penthouse is next to public housingCommentary: Even as Hong Kong embraces maskless normalcy, the city has changedHONG KONG MUST EXPLAIN ""TWO SYSTEMS"" TO OUTSIDE WORLDOf course, there will be people loudly decrying how a drastic rise in public housing supply might impact private home prices. This kind of argument is tired and hollow. In Singapore, over 80 per cent of people live in high-rise blocks developed and managed by the government’s Housing & Development Board. That has not depressed private home prices in the island state (the influx of immigrants probably helps).Equally important, Hong Kong must do more to explain the beauty of “two systems” to the outside world, including even Beijing, so as to robustly defend the city’s autonomy and freedoms. The city must do a better job of using its influence on Beijing and lobbying the central government to rethink the policies which directly impact Hong Kong.For instance, in this space in June, I wrote about how exit bans are hurting China’s efforts to welcome foreign business.Many of the people who have been banned from leaving the mainland because of a business dispute or connection with individuals under investigation are from Hong Kong. The latest example is Charles Wang Zhonghe, a Hong Kong-based senior banker at Nomura, a Japanese firm.So far Hong Kong officials seem to believe their hands are tied under “one country, two systems”. But that does not mean there is nothing they can do. In fact, they can be proactive in using their connections so mainland officials may fully understand the dangers of such arbitrary enforcement of laws - which looks bad not only for the mainland but also for Hong Kong.Wang Xiangwei is a former editor-in-chief of the South China Morning Post. He now teaches journalism at Baptist University. This article was first published on SCMP.Related:Commentary: Is Hong Kong now just another Chinese city?

Picture taken December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo 01 Oct 2023 12:47PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SHANGHAI : China's new home prices rose slightly in September, breaking a four-month decline, data showed on Sunday, as developers sped up launches to take advantage of a recent slew of support measures. Prices rose 0.05 per cent on average from the previous month after falling since May, according to a survey by China Index Academy, a real estate research firm. Only 30 of the 100 cities surveyed reported a fall in new home prices.The biggest month-on-month increase since October 2021 driven by developers launching new, higher quality housing projects, the firm said in a report. Confidence in the property sector, which accounts for one-fourth of economic activity, has been hit since 2021 when Beijing cracked down on debt accumulation by developers, fuelling a debt crisis. Deepening problems in the sector this year have dragged on the world's second-biggest economy and rattled global financial markets.China has announced a raft of measures in recent weeks to boost home-buying sentiment, including easing some borrowing rules and relaxing home purchasing curbs in some cities.These policies have given major cities like Beijing a tiny boost in new home sales, but some worry the improvement might be short-lived and could potentially dry up demand in smaller cities.If such policies continue to be optimised, the report said, the market in first-tier cities are likely to stabilise this quarter while recovery in smaller cities might take longer. China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted property developer, with more than $300 billion in liabilities, said on Thursday its founder was being investigated over suspected crimes.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo 28 Sep 2023 11:07PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: Heavily indebted property giant China Evergrande said on Thursday (Sep 28) its boss was suspected of ""illegal crimes"" after trading of its shares was suspended earlier in the day.The company announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange comes a day after media reports that Xu Jiayin was being held by police.No specific reason was given for the decision to suspend share trading, which also affected the company's property services and electric vehicle units. But late Thursday, the company said it had ""received notification from relevant authorities"" that Xu ""has been subject to mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes"", without giving further details.On Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported Xu was being held under ""residential surveillance"" - which does not mean he has been arrested or charged with a crime - citing anonymous sources.The firm has become the poster child for China's growing property-sector crisis that has seen several high-profile firms engulfed in a sea of debt, fuelling fears about the country's wider economy and a possible spillover globally.It is just a month since the firm resumed trading following a 17-month halt caused by its failure to publish its financial results. Evergrande estimated it had debts of US$328 billion at the end of June.On Sunday, the company said it was unable to issue new debt as its subsidiary, Hengda Real Estate Group, was being investigated. And last Friday, it said meetings planned this week on a key debt restructuring would not take place.The firm said it was ""necessary to reassess the terms"" of the plan in order to suit the ""objective situation and the demand of the creditors"".The company's property arm this week missed a key bond payment, and Chinese financial website Caixin reported that former executives had been detained.The crisis has deepened a broader slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.The property sector has long been a key pillar of growth - along with construction it accounts for about a quarter of GDP - and it experienced a dazzling boom in recent decades.But the massive debt accrued by its biggest players has been seen by Beijing in recent years as an unacceptable risk for China's financial system and overall economic health.Related:China Evergrande's billionaire boss Hui Ka Yan goes from power circles to police surveillance Pressure piles on China Evergrande with chairman Hui Ka Yan under police surveillanceMajor Evergrande creditor group to seek liquidation if no new debt plan soon: Sources""CONTAGION RISK""Policymakers have come under intense pressure in recent months to unveil measures to support the economy and particularly the property sector.However, they are not keen on the type of bonanza unveiled in 2008 during the financial crisis, meaning the government could struggle to hit its growth target of around 5 per cent for this year. Even that would represent one of its worst performances in decades, excluding the pandemic.Moody's Analytics assistant director-economist Heron Lim told AFP: ""If Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg and contagion risks materialise, a crisis of confidence in the onshore debt markets that have thus far avoided many of the defaults could erupt and lead to a severe downturn.""Authorities have gradually tightened developers' access to credit since 2020, and a wave of defaults has followed - notably that of Evergrande.The long-running housing crisis has wreaked misery on the lives of homebuyers across the country, who have often staked life savings on properties that never materialised.A wave of mortgage boycotts spread nationwide last summer, as cash-strapped developers struggled to raise enough to complete homes they had already sold in advance - a common practice in China.Earlier this month, authorities in the southern city of Shenzhen said they had arrested several Evergrande employees and called on the public to report any cases of suspected fraud.Another Chinese property giant, Country Garden, narrowly avoided default in recent months, after reporting a record loss and debts of more than US$150 billion.""Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility that the ultimate end-game is a much smaller property sector,"" Louise Loo, lead China economist at Oxford Economics, told AFP. ""That likely means no private sector developer is too big or systemic to fail.""""Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility that the ultimate end-game is a much smaller property sector,"" Louise Loo, lead China economist at Oxford Economics, told AFP.

Evergrande and the police authorities have not responded to Reuters requests for comment.Evergrande has been working to get creditors' approval for restructuring its offshore debt. The process got complicated this week after Evergrande said it was unable to issue new debt due to an investigation into its main China unit.The offshore debt restructuring plan now looks set to falter and the risks of the company being liquidated are rising, some analysts said.Reuters reported on Tuesday that a major Evergrande offshore creditor group was planning to join a liquidation court petition filed against the developer if it does not submit a new debt revamp plan by the end of October.Related:China Evergrande's billionaire boss Hui Ka Yan goes from power circles to police surveillance Pressure piles on China Evergrande with chairman Hui Ka Yan under police surveillance""It is unclear why Hui is under police surveillance, but it may signal certain negotiations demanded from the government. The latest development has disrupted the hope of restructuring,"" said Gary Ng, Asia Pacific senior economist at Natixis.""No developer is too big to fail in China, and therefore it is hard to imagine a full bail-out. Still, when it comes to stability, it is possible to see more government influence in different ways,"" Ng said.The company shares ended down 19 per cent on Wednesday in the Hong Kong market, taking their losses to 81 per cent since the resumption of trading in late August after a 17-month suspension.Evergrande's latest woes come against the backdrop of Beijing rolling out a raft of measures in the last few weeks, including cutting of existing mortgage rates, to revive the battered property sector.The recent regulatory easing may stabilise the housing market in the world's second-largest economy to some extent, Saxo Greater China Market Strategist Redmond Wong wrote in a research note.""Still, the overhang of housing inventories in lower-tier cities facing population decline will persist for several years,"" he said.""This will lead to more headlines about defaults, restructuring, and liquidation of insolvent developers, causing losses for shareholders, bondholders, banks, and investors in trust and wealth management products tied to property projects.""

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will keep liquidity reasonably ample and maintain stable credit expansion, the bank said in a statement after a quarterly meeting of its monetary policy committee.""The current external environment is becoming more complex and severe, international economic trade and investment are slowing down, inflation is still high, and interest rates in developed countries remain high,"" the central bank said.""The domestic economy continues to recover and improve, with increasing momentum, but it still faces challenges such as insufficient demand.""""We need to continue to work hard and take advantage of the improving momentum, step up macro policy adjustments, implement the prudent monetary policy in a precise and forceful manner,"" the PBOC said.The wording in the latest comments was consistent with the line taken earlier by the central bank, though the remarks on the economy appeared slightly more positive as the PBOC had said in its April statement that the recovery lacked solid foundations. The world's second-largest economy is showing some signs of stabilising after a flurry of modest policy measures, but the outlook is clouded by a property downturn, aging demographics, high debt and geopolitical tensions.The central bank will guide banks to lower borrowing costs for companies and households and support banks to replenish capital, it said.China will step up government investment and policy incentives to spur private investment and promote a recovery in prices from a low level, the central bank said.The PBOC reaffirmed its stance of keeping the yuan stable and preventing the risk of currency overshooting.The central bank also pledged to promote the healthy and stable development of the property market, implementing policies to lower down payment ratios and mortgages rates for some home buyers.The central bank will step up its support for the building of public infrastructure for both normal and emergency use in megacities, the transformation of ""urban villages"", or underdeveloped areas, and affordable housing, it said.The cabinet has announced guidelines to boost investment in such areas as part of efforts to support the economy.

REUTERS/Aly Song 27 Feb 2023 01:40PM (Updated: 27 Feb 2023 04:42PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING : China's new home prices will see a deepening fall in the first half of the year before rebounding at a faster pace in 2023, according to a Reuters poll, as the scrapping of COVID-19 curbs and stimulus policies improve sentiment.New home prices are expected to fall 1.0 per cent year-on-year in the first half of 2023, deepening from a fall of 0.5 per cent forecast for that period in a November survey, according to 13 analysts and economists polled by Reuters between Feb. 17 and Feb. 24.For 2023, prices are expected to rise 2.5 per cent, faster than an increase of 1.0 per cent forecast in the previous poll.Consumers' income and expectations are recovering slowly and the housing supply is exceeding demand in small cities, said Lu Zhe, chief economist at Topsperity Securities.""A rebound in demand will drive price improvements with the economy recovering in the second half of the year,"" Lu said.The crisis-hit property sector has been hobbled by flagging demand and mounting debt defaults with falls in sales and prices. A tentative property sector revival was seen in January, with home prices rising for the first time in a year, boosted by aggressive government support late last year, lower mortgage rates and a U-turn on the ""zero COVID"" containment policy. Demand, however, remains sluggish, and is a major constraint to a long-term rebound but analysts expect a sustainable recovery will begin towards the second half of this year.Slower growth in the population and factors limiting a market recovery such as declining incomes, expectations of falling house prices and stalled construction projects, have not seen a fundamental reversal, said Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy.Property sales are expected to slump 9.0 per cent in the first half of the year, a bigger drop than the 5.0 per cent fall forecast in the November poll. Economists expect a 1.5 per cent slump in sales for the whole of 2023, a bigger drop than the 1.0 per cent fall expected in the last poll, the survey found.""As the impact of COVID-19 fades, we expect monthly housing sales will be smoother than the year before,"" said Xingping Wang, senior analyst at Fitch Bohua.However, it will take time for the market to find its bottom and sales will only recover slowly, Wang said.Markets are waiting for a relaxation of restrictions on prices, purchases and sales that authorities in so-called first-tier cities imposed to rein in surging prices and speculation.While all who took part in the survey said it was unlikely that the curbs in first-tier cities would be completely lifted, some marginal easing was possible.""The relaxation of regulations in first-tier cities has a very important demonstration effect. We believe that the regulator will be more careful to determine the scale and timing of policy relaxation in first-tier cities,"" said Fitch Bohua's Wang.Analysts have also said China will gradually increase the proportion of finished new homes for sale in the market, with some even suggesting that pre-sales may be abolished.Several Chinese provinces said this month they will start to test a requirement for developers to only list finished homes for sale. Delayed construction by cash-strapped developers triggered mortgage boycotts last year.On housing affordability over the coming year, 11 of 12 analysts who responded to the question saw improvements in the coming year.(For other stories from the Reuters quarterly housing market polls:) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang 13 Jan 2023 03:54PM (Updated: 13 Jan 2023 04:08PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SHANGHAI : China's central bank is likely to at least maintain current liquidity in the banking system on Monday through its management of medium-term policy loans, while keeping borrowing costs unchanged for a fifth straight month, a Reuters survey showed.The People's Bank of China (PBOC) would be keeping an eye on routinely high pre-holiday cash demands of households and corporates, traders and analysts said. It would want to ensure there was enough liquidity for that purpose and also to boost the economy, which is recovering from COVID-19 shocks, they said.This year the week-long Lunar New Year holiday will begin on Jan. 21.The PBOC manages liquidity by extending loans to banks under its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF). This month, 700 billion yuan ($104 billion) of such debt is maturing.Twelve analysts expected the central bank to replace that debt exactly with 700 billion yuan of new lending, and 10 expected it to go further and lend a greater amount. The other three participants expected only partial rollover of the maturing debt.A great majority - 21 traders and analysts - expected the MLF interest rate to stay unchanged at 2.75 per cent this month, while the remaining four respondents expected a small rate cut.""As the 700 billion yuan of MLF maturity comes ahead of the Chinese New Year, a full coverage of the liquidity as a minimum is probably needed,"" said Frances Cheung, rates strategist at OCBC Bank.""But it is a matter of the use of instruments; if part of the liquidity is compensated for by short-term reverse repos, it would be a disappointment to the market."" Short-term reverse repos are another PBOC tool for managing liquidity.Markets still expect some monetary policy easing measures to support economic recovery, including cuts to policy rates and the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves.Slow credit demand, benign domestic inflation and a strengthening yuan should all allow further policy manoeuvre, they said.""Subdued domestic price pressures mean that inflation will not be a constraint for monetary policy easing,"" analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.""The PBOC will likely cut interest rates soon to aid the expected economic recovery this year.""The MLF rate serves as a guide to the country's benchmark interest rates, the one and five year loan prime rates (LPRs), which will next be fixed on Jan. 20. The MLF and LPR rates usually move together.Some traders expect some monetary easing, probably a cut to the five-year LPR, to aid the wobbling housing sector, following a slew of recent stimulus measures.""It is still possible that the PBOC will cut the MLF rate further by 10 basis points (bps) in Q1, leading to a further decline in the LPR, especially for the 5-year,"" analysts at Standard Chartered said in a note.""But more cuts beyond this level are unlikely as China banks' net interest margin (NIM) has fallen to a record low.""($1 = 6.7361 Chinese yuan) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Thomas Peter 06 Jan 2023 10:33AM (Updated: 06 Jan 2023 03:46PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG :Shares of Chinese property developers climbed on Friday, lifted by more state support for the highly indebted sector struggling with weak sales and investments as China reopens its economy.The central bank said on Thursday that for cities where the selling prices of new homes fall month-on-month and year-on-year for three consecutive months, the floor on mortgage rates can be lowered or abolished for first-time home buyers in phases.China is also planning to relax restrictions on borrowing for property developers by dialing back the ""three red lines"" policy, Bloomberg News reported on Friday. The property sector, which accounts for a quarter of China's economy, was badly hit last year as many developers were unable to finish building projects that led to mortgage boycotts by some buyers. Lockdowns and movement control measures to control the spread of COVID-19 also hurt buyer sentiment. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index firmed 2.3 per cent in mid-afternoon trade, after jumping close to 4 per cent shortly after the market open.As of 0709 GMT, Logan Group gained more than 10 per cent, while top leader Country Garden rose 6.6 per cent. That compared with a flat broader market.""Positive news of state help have mostly been priced-in in the short term after many share prices more than doubled in the past month,"" said CGS-CIMB analyst Will Chu. ""For the sector to re-rate, the market will need to see a meaningful contract sales improvement in March.""China's deeply troubled property sector is set to see home sales fall for the second straight year in 2023, but the pace of declines will ease helped by policy support measures and the lifting of the government's strict anti-COVID policies.Property sales are expected to slip by a median of 8 per cent this year, a Reuters survey of eight economists and analysts showed, compared with a slump of around 25 per cent in 2022, as economic activity, household income and consumer confidence are seen rebounding in the second half.The housing authorities vowed on Thursday to give strong support to first-time home buyers by allowing smaller down payments and cutting mortgage interest rates.Ni Hong, head of China's housing regulator, told state broadcaster CCTV that ""reasonable"" support needs to be given to buyers of second homes although not for the purchase of three homes or more.THREE RED LINESTo help cash-strapped developers, Beijing may allow some property firms to add more leverage by easing borrowing caps, and push back the grace period for meeting debt targets set by the ""three red lines"" policy, Bloomberg reported on Friday.Markets raised questions about the policy, introduced in late 2020, after developers who met all three debt ratio requirements also defaulted, including Kaisa Group and Yuzhou Group. Sources have told Reuters banks have been disregarding the policy since the debt crisis and were reluctant to lend to even developers who have passed the three red lines due to concerns about the impact of such exposure on their balance sheets. ""A healthy balance sheet doesn't necessarily mean good liquidity in companies,"" said CGS-CIMB's Chu. ""Regulators want to send a signal that the policy will not be so strict anymore because it's not good for the economy and market.""

REUTERS/Eduardo Baptista 06 Jan 2023 07:05AM (Updated: 06 Jan 2023 07:47AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: China's deeply troubled property sector is set to see home sales fall for the second straight year in 2023, but the pace of declines will ease thanks to state support measures and the lifting of the government's strict anti-COVID policies.Property sales are expected to slip by a median of 8 per cent this year, a Reuters survey of eight economists and analysts showed, compared to a slump of around 25 per cent in 2022, as economic activity, household income and consumer confidence are seen rebounding in the second half.Economists and analysts believe policymakers will roll out more support measures to stimulate home demand this year, as part of Beijing's overall goal to bolster the US$17-trillion economy after a sharp COVID-induced downturn in 2022.Those policies could include further lowering of mortgage borrowing rates and down-payment requirements, as well as relaxing home purchase restrictions in top-tier Chinese cities, they added.Hopes of a pickup in the economy later this year have been fuelled by China's dismantling in December of its stringent zero-COVID policy, which likely dragged GDP growth down to just 3 per cent last year, one of its worst years in almost half a century.But the reversal has triggered a wave of COVID-19 infections, which are expected to cause further economic disruptions and strain households for at least a few more months.MORTGAGE REVOLTChina's property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy, was badly hit last year as cash-squeezed developers were unable to finish apartment construction, prompting a mortgage boycott by some buyers. Citywide lockdowns to control the pandemic and layoffs also weighed heavily on buyer sentiment.Property investment in November fell the fastest since the statistics bureau began compiling data in 2000, down 19.9 per cent on year.""For 2023, we expect a sequential rebound in both sales and property new starts, as property policies continue to ease, and re-opening after COVID leads to a rebound in economic activity and household income,"" said UBS chief China economist Tao Wang.""Although property sales and starts will likely be slightly weaker than in 2022, property will be much less of a drag on the economy than in 2022.""There are some early signs of a turnaround.New-home sales rose more than 20 per cent over the three-day New Year holiday from a year-ago due to promotions, support policies and the gradual release of pent-up demand after high COVID-19 cases, the China Index Academy said this week.The academy said major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai saw a rise in sales compared with last year's New Year holiday, but sentiment remained at low levels in most small cities.Related:China's finance minister promises 'appropriate' 2023 fiscal expansionChina developer forced to sack 90% of workers in bid to surviveHOUSING DEMANDShares in embattled Chinese property developers have gained 86 per cent since the trough in October, buoyed by a string of property easing measures and the COVID policy u-turn.An index tracking high-yield dollar bonds of Chinese developers has more than doubled from its Nov 3 low, but is still 30 per cent lower than the beginning of this year, and 58 per cent lower than its peak in May, 2021 after a series of defaults.""I think the market has been ruthlessly efficient in repricing the positive policy noises that have come through,"" said Tim Gibson, co-head of global property equities at Janus Henderson Investors.""In terms of what the market needs to see, I think that really goes back to the point on the demand side.""Gavekal Dragonomics expects a rise of 5 per cent-10 per cent in property sales this year, while Citi has forecast a 21 per cent drop, citing time needed for job and home price expectations to recover, as well as a drop in new supply.Sheldon Chan, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager of T Rowe, said there's chance that the property recovery ""may be slower than that the market seems to be pricing or potentially pricing"".""We may be close to see some bottoming out in housing demand ... but I don't think we're quite there yet,"" he said.The latest China Beige Book private economic survey was more blunt: ""But forget a return to days of old: it will take considerable policy support in 2023 just to pull property out of the gutter.""DOLLAR BOND MARKETDespite hopes of a modest improvement in home demand this year, the sector's recovery is expected to be a long and bumpy one, still weighed down by excesses of the past.Many developers are expected to struggle to significantly ease their stifling funding squeeze, weighing on their ability to purchase new land and repay offshore creditors.For many private developers, being absent from the land market last year also means they may have fewer projects for sale in 2023, in turn constraining their cash flow.Moreover, 2023 will see a high offshore debt maturity wall totalling US$141 billion, compared to US$120.7 billion in 2022, data by Refinitiv show. The figure represents the amount at issue and does not reflect redemptions and defaults.Providing good quality and unpledged asset collateral is the biggest challenge for developers in both raising domestic bonds and obtaining offshore bank loans, in which proceeds can be used for offshore repayments, three developers told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive to regulators.As a result, Cosmo Zhang, credit analyst at Vontobel Asset Management, said the sector would see more debt restructuring.""There are still a few names we think, even if they haven't defaulted yet, they probably still need to restructure their capital structure in the coming years, to be sustainable. Their capital structure is not sustainable.""

But prices were expected to rise 1.0 per cent for the full year.""For 2023, property indexes are expected to see a turning point and consumer confidence will improve with the economy completely stabilised after COVID restrictions ease,"" said Li Zongguang, chief economist at China Renaissance Holdings Limited.""Property measures are expected to strengthen support, which will improve residents' confidence.""Woes in China's real estate market, which accounts for about a quarter of its $17 trillion economy, deepened in October, weighed down by COVID-19 curbs and industry-wide problems. New home prices fell at their fastest pace in over seven years in October and sales slumped for the 15th straight month.A recent slew of support measures, including loan repayment extensions, aimed at improving liquidity in the property sector has underpinned market sentiment.But analysts and economists in the poll expected concerns about falling house prices, protracted COVID restrictions, and delays in construction to continue to weigh on demand.Property sales were seen slumping 5.0 per cent in the first half of 2023, a smaller drop than the 15.0 per cent fall forecast in the September poll. Economists expected a 1.0 per cent slump in sales for the whole of 2023, the survey showed.Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, expected the market to gradually stabilise as the financing measures boosted confidence, but she did not expect a V-shaped rebound, stressing the need for more policies targeting demand.""More home purchase support policy is needed,"" especially a move to ease some home purchase curbs in major cities, Huang added.Demand for property took a big hit this past year as many developers lurched from crisis to crisis and halted the construction of apartments as they ran out of money. Beijing last week eased some of its COVID curbs with officials flagging further fine-tuning of restrictions, raising hopes of a complete reopening after annul parliamentary meetings in the spring of 2023.Some analysts say average house prices will need to fall by around 20 per cent to 30 per cent to entice demand.(This story has been refiled to correct home prices to rise 1.0 per cent in 2023, not 1.8 per cent)(For other stories from the Reuters quarterly housing market polls:) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo 18 Nov 2022 07:06AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING/HONG KONG : A slew of recent supportive measures will bring China's cash-strapped property developers much needed relief, but a full recovery of the sector will be hobbled by increasingly elusive buyers, say bankers, developers and analysts.From a sweeping purge a couple of years ago to a series of financing measures now, China's changed approach towards the property sector, a key pillar of the economy, reflects how dire the situation has become.Weighed down by protracted COVID-19 curbs, falling home prices and rising unemployment in the world's second-largest economy, many prospective buyers are putting off their plans, creating challenges for developers and policymakers.""These policies will have little lasting effect and the property prices will not go up significantly,"" said Jack Yang, an engineer in Beijing, noting ""future income"" had become a key concern for homebuyers.Yang said he had put plans to sell his home and buy a new one on hold due to COVID restrictions, cuts in his salary and concerns he may lose his job.Chinese regulators outlined 16 supportive measures last week, mainly aimed at boosting liquidity for developers, in the most comprehensive rescue package for the sector since it was hit by a debt crisis last year.Graphic: China property slump https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-PROPERTY/zjpqjkenavx/chart.pngMarkets cheered the measures, which included loan repayment extensions and easier access to fresh funding, but bankers and analysts say they only address the property market's supply problems, with the demand recovery still a key concern.Demand for property, a sector that accounts for roughly a quarter of China's economy, took a big hit this past year as many developers lurched from crisis to crisis and halted the construction of apartments as they ran out of money.The economic fallout of COVID lockdowns in many cities also contributed to buyers like Yang putting off plans to take on debt to buy new homes - a trend, bankers and analysts say, is unlikely to change anytime soon.Property sales measured by floor area fell for a 15th straight month in October, while new home prices fell at their fastest pace in over seven years, official data showed this week.Graphic: China's falling home prices https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-PROPERTY/gdpzqywkovw/chart.pngJohn Lam, head of China and Hong Kong property research at UBS said the government's move to support liquidity ""kind of breaks the negative cycle"", adding this ""should be a positive in terms of the demand recovery"".But rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday it was sticking to its forecast for a ""largely flat trend"" in new home sales in 2023 even after the latest support measures.Housing demand ""hinges on a recovery in homebuyers' sentiment and employment prospects, which we think depends on sustained easing of China's pandemic-related controls,"" it said.China last week eased some COVID rules, but analysts say the zero-COVID strategy will continue to weigh on economic activity.While Beijing has cut mortgage costs and relaxed some curbs this year to boost new home purchases, analysts say authorities' focus mostly on affordable housing and President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" push are likely to keep a lid on demand.CREDIT RISK The fall in home prices is a major concern for homebuyers in China given a large share of them buy new homes as an investment option, with returns historically reaching as high as 30 per cent-50 per cent over a period of time in some cities. Despite the recent liquidity-boosting measures, some bankers say developers continue to face credit risks given the uncertain outlook.Graphic: Dwindling liquidity https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-PROPERTY/lgvdkwljlpo/chart.png""The measures will improve the real estate financing environment, which means that for banks, the vicious cycle and death spiral between real estate risks and financial risks have been alleviated,"" said an official at a mid-sized commercial bank.""But it is too early to say that the credit risk alert of real estate has been lifted,"" said the banker, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.According to UBS, Chinese banks have roughly 88 trillion yuan ($12.43 trillion) worth of exposure to the property sector.It estimates the property sector downturn will cost the banking system up to 1.4-1.5 trillion yuan in the next few years, mainly from potential losses in banks' unsecured property development loans, bonds, and non-standard assets.For now, however, the main concern for some homebuyers is whether the latest measures will enable developers to come out of the crisis and resume the construction of apartments.Sam Wang, a 22-year-old freelancer in the catering industry, said a relative had bought ""a property for presale in full payment"" in Wuhan about three years ago, but it was still unfinished.""For me, I am about to buy a house for residential purposes, and in the short term, I'll take a wait-and-see attitude,"" said Wang.($1 = 7.0802 Chinese yuan renminbi) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

(Photo: Reuters/Aly Song) 16 Nov 2022 01:02PM (Updated: 16 Nov 2022 01:31PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: Global investors Warburg Pincus and Greystar Real Estate Partners are pushing deeper into China's rental housing, as a growing number of distressed developers are looking to divest some of their assets to temper a stifling liquidity crunch.The two asset managers, whose focus is on top-tier Chinese cities for rental business, are in talks with distressed developers to take over assets including offices and hotels to turn them into rental housing, their executives told Reuters.Beijing has been promoting rental housing in recent years as runaway home prices in major cities shut out many young buyers - a plan that has assumed greater significance in the wake of the debt crisis in the property sector and a weaker economy, industry officials said.The state push is also backed by potentially lucrative returns - depending on the business model, returns on rental housing projects could be between high single digit and high teens.""There's a lot more cash crunch pressure being faced by developers and asset owners, now we're able to get deals on a more attractive basis than we were in 2017-2021,"" said Charles Ma, managing director of Greystar China.""That'd allow us to build very strong pipeline.""Greystar, which has two rental projects in Shanghai, is also considering entry into the affordable rental segment - a subsidised segment for low-income families and young people - to cash in on higher margins due to favourable policies, Ma said.According to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, the size of the rental housing market in China is expected to increase to 2.7 trillion yuan (US$372.25 billion) by 2026, after rising to 1.8 trillion yuan in 2021 from 1.2 trillion yuan in 2017.Warburg Pincus also sees more opportunities in rental housing because of increasingly attractive asset prices and less competition from cash-strapped local developers.""Warburg Pincus will be more active in the (next) three years to look for assets for conversion into rental housing,"" said Qiqi Zhang, managing director of Warburg Pincus, which has investments in Chinese apartment rental brands.Warburg-backed Chinese apartment rental brands include TULU, Ziroom, Base and Mofang, which has filed an initial public offering (IPO) application in Hong Kong in what would be a key test for investor appetite for such businesses in China.""MORE ACTIVE""Chinese property stocks rallied earlier in the week on Beijing's ""most comprehensive"" support measures for the sector. As part of that, regulators have asked trust companies to provide financing to developers for rental housing construction and acquisitions.Reuters reported in July China will launch a fund worth up to US$44 billion to bankroll the purchases of unfinished home projects and complete their construction, and then rent them to individuals as part of the drive to boost rental housing.Beijing's recent measures to bolster the sector would benefit some stronger developers, industry officials said, as some of them are also looking to grow their rental business to cushion the impact of slowing property sales.China Vanke and Longfor Group, the country's biggest providers of rental apartments with a presence in tier one and two cities, are among the developers keen on rentals, according to company statements and industry sources.""The biggest incentive is the current market situation - as the economy is not doing well, rental business actually turns better,"" said a developer who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Beijing-based Longfor said during its first-half earnings conference in August that its rental housing business swung to profit last year after operations began in 2016, and it told Reuters in October it will continue to expand its portfolio in major cities in the country.Vanke declined to comment.""Rental is about living demand; it's more stable than investment volatility. Across cycles, investment demand may have been affected but not overall housing demand,"" said Warburg Pincus' Zhang.Related:‘She got an abortion, broke up with me’: The human suffering behind China’s property crisis Source: Reuters/zl Related Topics China property Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

That was the biggest annual drop since August 2015 and the sixth month of contraction. Regulators outlined 16 measures as part of a rescue package on Sunday aimed at boosting liquidity in the property sector, including loan repayment extensions. Markets cheered the measures, which sent property stocks soaring on Monday.In an effort to relieve the liquidity crunch, China's banking and insurance regulator also said on Monday it would allow property developers to access some pre-sale funds.But analysts worry the support measures could be ineffective because they are not targeting weakening demand and think the recovery is likely to be bumpy, as evidenced by downbeat property figures earlier this week.""It should be noted that the current problem facing the real estate industry is no longer just for property, but more of economic income expectations,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline.""In the short term, the property market will remain in the doldrums in the fourth quarter.""China's property sector has struggled with defaults and stalled projects since authorities started to clamp down on excessive leverage in mid-2020, hitting market confidence and weighing on economic activity.New home prices declined 0.3 per cent month-on-month after easing 0.2 per cent in September. Out of the 70 cities surveyed by NBS, 58 reported month-on-month price falls in October, up from 54 cities in September.Data on Tuesday also pointed to further weakness in the cash-strapped sector, showing property investment fell at its fastest pace in 32 months in October and sales slumped for the 15th straight month.The softer data comes even as more than 200 local governments have taken steps to revive the sector this year, including relaxing mortgage rates and refunding individual income tax for some homebuyers.""Considering the protracted disruptions from dynamic zero-Covid policy, falling and unbalanced demographic demand, and policymakers' long-held stance that 'housing is for living in, not for speculation', we maintain our view that the property sector recovery should be gradual and bumpy,"" said Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Wednesday.

""We see property being much less of a drag to GDP (gross domestic product) growth in 2023,"" said Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS Investment Bank Research.The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index jumped more than 13.5 per cent to close at a two-month high, with the share prices of many Chinese property developers posting double-digit gains.Country Garden rallied 45.5 per cent to hit an over three-month high. Logan Group, KWG Group, Agile Group and R&F Properties all rose more than 30 per cent.A dollar bond of defaulted Yango Group due 2023 rose 1.787 cents on the dollar to 2.712 in early trade, according to data from Duration Finance. Powerlong Real Estate's April 2025 bond was traded at 9.275 cents, 3.055 cents higher than Friday. Their bonds also surged onshore. Two sources told Reuters on Sunday a notice to financial institutions from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) outlined 16 steps to support the property sector, including loan repayment extensions.PBOC and CBIRC have not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.Meanwhile, the CBIRC on Friday issued a notice allowing commercial banks to issue letters of guarantee to real estate firms for escrow pre-sale housing funds. AILING PROPERTY MARKET Citi said the package signals a major shift in regulators' policy stance on developers, from ""imposing restrictions"" to ""providing support"", and ""rescuing projects, but not developers"" to ""rescuing both developers and projects"".The notice ""introduced by far the most comprehensive set of support measures for the ailing property market,"" it said.Jefferies estimated the package, together with other recent policies, would inject around 1.3 trillion yuan ($183.83 billion) credit into the property sector, largely covering private developers' public bonds and trust products due to mature by end-2023.Last week, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors said it would widen a programme to support about 250 billion yuan worth of debt sales by private firms, including property developers. Some investors remained cautious about the impact of the latest policy, however, as regulators have already made many attempts to revive the property sector and the macro environment remains weak amid the country's COVID restrictions. China's property sector has slowed sharply this year as the government sought to restrict excessive borrowing by developers.The clampdown has triggered falls in property sales and prices, bond defaults and the suspension of housing construction, angering homeowners which have threatened to stop mortgage payments. Private data released earlier in November showed home prices in 100 cities dropped for a fourth month in October, while property sales by floor area fell about 20 per cent year-on-year. ""At the end of the day, the rebound of home sales is still needed for an ultimate industry comeback,"" said James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd. Li Gen, CEO of Beijing BG Capital Management Ltd, which specialises in credit investment, said developers that have not defaulted would benefit the most, but the help would be ""less meaningful"" for offshore property bonds as it remains unclear how offshore financing could be enhanced. Citi said the package should also help bank shares as it eases investors' concern on developers' credit risk. Banks with higher exposure to developers including Ping An Bank, Industrial Bank and China Merchants Bank, would particularly benefit, Citi added.($1 = 7.0718 Chinese yuan renminbi) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

Problems have deepened from the liquidity crunch, with debt-ridden developers defaulting on bond payments, homebuyers halting their mortgage payments on stalled projects and pandemic restrictions continuing to undermine demand.Beijing has rolled out a flurry of policies to revive the sector, including relaxing mortgage rates and refunding individual income tax for some homebuyers. But demand has yet to recover, with a decline in developer sales and investment underscoring the bleak outlook.""China's property market remains sluggish and is expected to stabilise in the fourth quarter, but still hovering at a low level,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline.The property market has been affected by falling confidence over the economic outlook, especially as cash-strapped developers halted construction on many projects, Zhang said.New home prices in September fell 0.2 per cent month-on-month after a 0.3 per cent drop in August, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released on Monday.On a year-on-year basis, new home prices in September declined at the fastest pace since August 2015, falling 1.5 per cent after a 1.3 per cent decline in August.WEAK CITIESOut of the 70 cities surveyed by NBS, 54 reported price falls in September, up from 50 cities in August.In monthly terms, new home prices in tier-two cities fell 0.2 per cent and declined 0.4 per cent in tier-three cities.""The property markets in lower-tier cities still face strong headwinds from weaker growth fundamentals than large cities, including net population outflows and potential oversupply problems,"" said Goldman Sachs in a research note.Separate data from the statistics bureau also showed the sector remained in a protracted slump, with developers struggling with weak demand.Property sales by floor area in September declined for a 14th consecutive month in September, down 16.15 per cent on year from a slump of 22.58 per cent in August, according to Reuters calculations based on official data.Property investment fell 12.1 per cent from a year earlier, slightly narrowing from a 13.8 per cent fall in August.POLICYChina wrapped up its twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle on Sunday, with Xi Jinping securing a third term as general secretary of the ruling Communist Party and packing the new Politburo Standing Committee with allies. China reiterated its ""housing is for living, but not for speculation"" in the full work report of the Communist Party Congress.Analysts said they did not expect big policy changes after the Congress.""There is little room to give more help to real estate property developers as doing so will risk the credibility of government reform (for property developers, that means the deleveraging reform),"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.""There could be some targeted policy to help mortgagors that bought uncompleted projects but they should not be considered preferential policies for real estate developers.""

REUTERS/Aly Song/ 14 Oct 2022 02:07PM (Updated: 14 Oct 2022 02:13PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG : Chinese real estate developers are delaying their debt restructuring moves until after the upcoming Communist Party Congress, hoping the crucial gathering offers clues on how Beijing plans to stabilise the embattled sector.What emerges at the meeting could help determine how the developers, who have missed payments or even defaulted on their offshore bonds worth tens of billions of dollars, pace any asset sales, extract or offer concessions to creditors, or even put themselves up for liquidation.While there is no consensus in the property industry on what specific sector measures, if any, are expected from the party congress - or in its immediate aftermath - and how far-reaching they could be, developers are nevertheless sitting tight.""The terms for the restructuring would be very different if the market recovers (post-congress meeting) and we are able to start selling and get cashflow rolling again,"" said a senior executive at a developer based in China's southern province of Guangdong, explaining the rationale for deferring the company's debt restructuring talks.The developer, which is in the process of restructuring after missing payments on some of its offshore debt, said in such a scenario bondholders would have more confidence in long-term repayments and the company could minimise disposal of core assets.If, however, Beijing does not introduce game-changing policies, developers could then take measures such as enforcing steep haircuts on bondholders or even liquidate, developers and restructuring advisers said. Some of the major developers in the process of restructuring their debt include China Evergrande Group, whose liquidity crunch last year was a turning point in the country's real estate crisis, Sunac China Holdings, Shimao Group Holdings and Kaisa Group Holdings. Smaller peers, which have done bond exchanges to extend the maturities of their debt, are also considering restructuring, the developers told Reuters.Graphic: China's real estate debt https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-CONGRESS/PROPERTY%20CHINA-CONGRESS/gkplgrybevb/China's%20real%20estate%20debt.PNGChina's twice-a-decade party congress kicks off on Oct. 16, during which President Xi Jinping is poised to secure a precedent-breaking third leadership term as general secretary. The makeup of China's economic leadership is set for its biggest overhaul in a decade. The property sector is crucial to China's political and economic stability, with real estate accounting for around 40 per cent of household assets, according to analysts, and making up around a quarter of the country's gross domestic product, the largest among all sectors.But after a government crackdown in 2020 on developers' debt-fuelled expansion, the sector has become a major headache for Beijing over the past year.Evergrande, with its $300 billion total debt and a default on its offshore debt last year, has cast an unwelcome light on Chinese developers' $5 trillion debt, rattling global markets and sparking rare protests.NO 'HEADLINES'An executive at another property company, which had previously planned to negotiate restructuring terms with offshore bondholders in the run-up to the party congress, said authorities told the developer to hold off on discussions to prevent any shock to the real estate market. ""To put it simply, the government doesn't want any headlines,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Echoing that apprehension ahead of the party congress, some fund managers and brokers have been told to avoid big share sales, two sources told Reuters.The debt crisis in the property sector has led to dwindling investment from developers and homebuyers. Now, many analysts expect China's GDP to grow at roughly 3 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 1976, excluding the 2.2 per cent expansion during the initial COVID hit in 2020, as the sector drags on the economy. China has already rolled out a plethora of measures to bolster housing demand and affordability, but home prices and sales have continued to contract. New home prices fell for the third straight month in September, a private survey showed. ""They have already tried so many relaxing measures and none of them worked,"" said a senior executive at a Shanghai-based developer. ""It is a confidence issue; people don't want to spend money to buy houses even if you lower the down-payment ratio or cut the mortgage rates.""Graphic: China's real estate growth https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-CONGRESS/PROPERTY%20CHINA-CONGRESS/znvneyalwpl/china-s-real-estate-growth-in-negative-territory-nbsp-.pngAnother real estate executive told Reuters the government was unlikely to reverse its goal to deleverage the sector, and cautioned that if no drastic support measures were announced at the party congress, disappointment could lead to a market rout.Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, said with Xi's principle of ""houses are for living, not for speculation"", she did not expect any material changes to property regulations. With the emphasis on local governments implementing ""city-specific"" measures without a coordinated nationwide effort, varying degrees of policy relaxation in different cities could squeeze liquidity and demand for other cities and lessen the overall policy impact, she told Reuters. ""The lack of specifics from the central government makes local governments, developers and homebuyers stay cautious,"" Wang said. ""Developers will not increase their investment while homebuyers don't know whether it is the bottom yet."" For some stakeholders, the stalling of the debt restructuring ahead of the party congress is frustrating. One bondholder told Reuters the developer it has a holding in kept delaying its restructuring timetable, initially from Chinese New Year in February, to a parliament meeting in March, and now to the party congress next week.""Every time they said there would be policy changes and we'd give you something after that. This kind of thing never ends, there's always an excuse,"" said the person, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.""They tell you a timetable but I don't think any of them is realistic; the companies have no clue either.""

REUTERS/Aly Song 13 Oct 2022 04:27PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING : Chinese local governments have started buying up homes to bring down high unsold housing stock, according to a state-owned newspaper, taking a fresh approach after a slew of stimulus property policies failed to boost fragile demand. China's property market has deepened its slump in recent months with declines in prices, sales and investment in August, while protracted COVID-19 restrictions and a mortgage boycott across the county have further dimmed the outlook. Homebuyers have moved cautiously even though more than 200 cities have taken steps to boost demand, offering subsidies, group-buying discounts, smaller down payments and cuts in mortgage interest rates.Now, the eastern city of Suzhou is planning to buy around 10,000 units of homes in its 10 districts, the Securities Times reported on Thursday. Home sales by floor area in Suzhou monitored by a private survey rose 126.88 per cent month-on-month in September. An industry insider cited by the newspaper said properties bought by the city government could be part of the increase. Other Chinese cities have made similar moves. A company owned by the eastern city of Jinan plans to buy 3,000 homes, and Handan in the north will purchase homes from developers to settle displaced residents in some urban renewal projects. Analysts told the newspaper the moves could help work down housing stock and prop up sentiment, but a boost to the property market will require homebuyer confidence in the long run.

Some of them may have already been touched by tragedy. The programme Insight uncovers their stories.For many home buyers in China, it has been a tortuous wait for their homes to be completed. Derrick A Paulo Wei Du @WeiDuCNA Andersen Xia Derrick A Paulo , Wei Du & Andersen Xia 02 Oct 2022 06:00AM (Updated: 02 Oct 2022 07:36AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HUNAN, China: He was supposed to be married by now and getting ready to be a father next year.Li (not his real name) had already bought an apartment to settle down, he had a girlfriend who was pregnant, and they were planning their wedding.But the 34-year-old now has no wife, no child and no home, only a mortgage that will follow him for the next 20 years.All because construction on his housing development, in China’s central province of Hunan, has been halted. That was enough for the girl’s parents to talk her out of marrying him.“They said an unfinished apartment isn’t a home, so she got an abortion and broke up with me,” recounted Li, a gig worker.“The abortion took away all my faith. My whole world collapsed … I was in extreme despair, but there was nothing I could do.” “Li” in his unfinished apartment. Yet, he understood their actions.“Any Chinese man can tell you: If you don’t have your own property, it’d be nearly impossible to find a wife — unless your ancestors lend you their powers from above,” he told the programme Insight.“(If you’re) a common man like me … you must, at the very least, have an apartment. Otherwise, no one will be willing to marry you. Even if someone’s willing, do you dare to marry her? Won’t you feel it’s not fair to her?Li’s uncompleted apartment tells many stories. It tells of the emotional weight the Chinese attach to the physical home. To them, it is not only a roof over one’s head but is part and parcel of what makes a family.It tells of the so-called mother-in-law economy, in a country where there are 35 million more men than women. Given the competition for brides, many prospective in-laws will not let their daughters marry a man without a home. The mother-in-law economy is a thing in China. And it tells of the human stories behind the fall of China’s housing market, which has been making headline news of late. Millions of Chinese are in limbo as cash-strapped developers halt construction.For Chinese millennials, who grew up with more than 30 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the current uncertainty is shaping up to be the first crisis on their hands.Thousands of home buyers have threatened to boycott mortgage payments. Some of them, such as Li, may have already suffered personal tragedy. Even the rest of the world may pay a price.‘THEY WERE FOOLING US’Li’s unfinished apartment block stands in Xiangtan, one of China’s fourth-tier cities.He had worked for years in Shanghai but grew tired of the competitive environment of a first-tier city. This was why he wanted to settle in a place with a slower pace of life and cheaper homes. Xiangtan in Hunan province was the hometown of Mao Zedong. His down payment was about 200,000 yuan (S$40,000), and he borrowed 500,000 yuan from the bank. “My monthly repayment isn’t a lot — about 3,000 yuan — because the apartment isn’t very big,” he said.The repayment accounts for nearly 35 per cent of his income.But for another home buyer, Tian (not his real name), his family’s monthly mortgage payment of 2,800 yuan is 70 per cent of their income. He also borrowed from his parents and some friends and got a bank loan of 400,000 yuan.He and his wife decided to buy their apartment in 2018, when she got pregnant. And it should have been “done and delivered” in August 2020, said Tian, who has a three-year-old boy in tow now.But it is the same housing project where Li wanted to start his family. “Tian” and his son in their unfinished apartment block. To compound matters, Tian lost his job in a chemical factory because of the pandemic. He has been unemployed for over half a year, so a manageable financial burden has become “quite heavy” with his wife as the sole breadwinner.“Not much left after repaying the mortgage,” he said.To put pressure on the developer and the local government, he and several of his fellow home buyers moved into their unfinished apartment blocks.But it means making do with apartments without electricity and running water, and using a toilet almost as far as half a kilometre away.To gain sympathy and generate buzz, they have spent evenings swapping stories and creating short videos to post on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. A still from a video posted on Douyin by one of the home buyers. As a last resort, Tian sent a letter to his bank in July, threatening to stop payments if construction did not resume by September. Other home owners did the same.“We’ve talked to the government as well as the developer. Neither could give a clear response,” he said. “They were just buying time and fooling us.”Backed into a corner, home buyers in more than 340 projects in about 120 Chinese cities now have declared a mortgage boycott, according to the GitHub open-source website titled “WeNeedHome”.The authorities have previously moved to restrict such posts on Chinese social media. Some home buyers took to the streets, but these protests were also quashed, with officials citing COVID-19 concerns.WATCH: China millennials’ mortgage boycott: Why the property crisis should worry you (7:46)Fearing retaliation, most of the home buyers Insight spoke to requested that their names be withheld. Their growing sentiment, however, is that of despair.“I have no clue when my home will be completed,” said Tian. “I see no light at the end of the tunnel.”Related articles:Commentary: Is China stumbling into its own mortgage crisis?SPECULATORS AND THE STORY OF YANJIAOChina’s property market has been put in jeopardy as a result of speculative buying. And the mother-in-law economy has played a part in it.“People were buying apartments for their sons (aged) 18 or 19 … because the son had to have an apartment if he was going to get married,” cited Peking University professor of finance Michael Pettis.“That looks like preparing for the future. But from a market point of view, that’s speculative buying: I’m buying not because I need it, but because I think the price will go up.” Michael Pettis has lived in Beijing for more than 20 years. Chinese parents were not the only speculators, however. Just ask Tu Qiang, a real estate agent in Yanjiao, a town in Hebei province.Because of the town’s proximity to Beijing, it became a popular choice for workers who wanted to buy a home but could not afford prices in the capital.In 2015 and 2016, “the best time for Yanjiao’s housing market”, prices climbed “continuously”, said Tu. For example, a new home would (sell) for 10,000 yuan per square metre today. But tomorrow, it’d be 12,000 yuan. The increase was insane.” With his “insider knowledge”, and because sales agents like himself “had very low base pay”, he wanted to jump on the property bandwagon.“Even if you sold more than 10 homes, you earned only tens of thousands (on commission). It was very little for the amount of work required,” he said.“At the same time, I felt the market was about to boom … so I borrowed some money from my friends and invested in my first property.” Real estate agent Tu Qiang (left) with clients. The market kept rising and he knew little about other industries, so he kept investing in real estate. “I was in my early 20s, and I already owned two to three properties, a car and lots of cash,” he recalled.“I felt very good about myself, but I wasn’t satisfied. I went a bit crazy and bought a few more properties at the peak of the market.”Between 2015 and 2017, home prices in Yanjiao nearly tripled. Alarmed, the local government implemented property curbs, for example allowing only people with hukou (local household registration) to buy. This ruled out workers in Beijing who would have otherwise commuted.Within a month, prices “dropped by two-thirds, more or less”, said Tu.Adding to the pain, Beijing sealed its borders after COVID-19 struck, making it impossible for workers to commute from neighbouring provinces, so even Yanjiao’s rental market evaporated. Yanjiao town in Hebei province. Tu was in a hole and “terrified”. “There was a time when I had no money to buy food and had to sleep in a park,” he recounted.“I had no idea what to do. I was so young, and … I felt the whole world crashing down. Every day when I opened my eyes, I was seized by worries over my debts.”NOT TOO BIG TO FAILThe massive fall in Yanjiao’s home prices is rather unique, to be sure, but China’s central government has also set out to curb housing speculation and clamp down on rapidly rising property prices since 2020.And property speculators are not the only ones to blame. The pre-sale system introduced in the 1990s, which allowed homes to be sold before they were built, turned Chinese developers into behemoths and, eventually, reckless players. Before the crisis, China was building 15 million homes a year, five times as many as in the United States and Europe combined, according to the Economist. While pre-sales happen in other places like the United Kingdom, buyers in China needed to make their mortgage repayments before the delivery of the apartment instead of starting payments only upon completion or key collection.This would usually happen a year to a year and a half in advance, which is why Li, Tian and all the protesting home buyers are already bearing a financial strain.These payments should have been set aside for the building project. But that did not always happen. Developers like Evergrande — China’s second-largest property developer by sales in 2020 — used its capital to invest in future expansion.At its peak, Evergrande had over 1,300 projects across China, with homes owned by 12 million families, plus the country’s largest land bank at more than 300 square kilometres. Founded in Guangzhou, Evergrande moved to Shenzhen in 2017. But it was so indebted that when the authorities prohibited over-leveraged developers from borrowing more, it defaulted on its debts last year — debts worth US$300 billion (S$430 billion), or 2 per cent of China’s gross domestic product.Many of its projects became rotten-tail buildings, a name for unfinished housing projects.Qiang (not his real name) never saw it coming. Evergrande’s massive scale was what gave him confidence to buy one of its apartments in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, without even visiting the project site.“I just thought it was such a big name. I was naive to think that it must be a strong company,” he said. Even when he first heard that Evergrande had run into trouble, he “wasn’t very worried”.“I was thinking, it was a huge matter that involved not only us but thousands of families. Evergrande owned so many projects across the nation.” “Qiang” bought an apartment in the Evergrande City Zhengzhou development. As it turned out, the company founded in 1996 by tycoon Xu Jiayin was not too big to fail.And Qiang, whose monthly mortgage payment is about 8,300 yuan, must contend with the reality that his apartment, which was due by July 31, “can’t be delivered because it’s still not completed”.“The pandemic has … (had) a huge impact on my job,” he added. “So it’s been very difficult for me these two years.”‘IT’S NOT JUST CHINA’S PROBLEM’Evergrande was only the first to fall. According to rating agency S&P, around 40 per cent of mainland property developers are now in financial distress.The agency estimates that about two million unfinished homes pre-sold by developers have been halted. There is also a risk that 2.4 million homes pre-sold in 2020 and last year may not be completed on schedule, estimates Bank of America.WATCH: The great fall of China’s housing market — who will pay the price? (46:56)The impact has spread beyond home buyers, however, to other industries.For example, in Guangdong province’s Foshan, the city recognised as China’s centre for the production of ceramic tiles — a popular flooring material used by developers — its ceramics industry was operating at half capacity in the first half of this year.“Owing to the pandemic … and the real estate slump, we’ve been making no profit,” said one ceramics vendor. “We used to (make) 100,000 yuan in a day, but we now (make) less than 10,000 yuan … Can’t even make the rent.”A decades-long boom has made real estate “the single most important sector” in China’s economy, noted Pettis. It has been estimated that construction and its related industries, from tile makers to furniture makers, account for 29 per cent of GDP. In Foshan, buyers for ceramic tiles are few and far between these days. “It’s really, really likely that we’re going to see a rise in insolvencies,” predicted Pettis.Home prices are already falling in the world’s second-largest economy. S&P is forecasting a 6 to 7 per cent drop this year.That means the Chinese middle-class who own one or more homes will be feeling less rich and more reluctant to buy cars, handbags and watches or travel abroad, passing up opportunities such as this weekend’s Formula 1 race in Singapore.“If the Chinese economy were to stall as a result of this property and debt crisis, it’s not just China’s problem,” noted Donald Low, the director of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Institute for Emerging Market Studies.“It’s in everybody’s interest that China makes this successful transition.”Since the mortgage boycott first emerged at the end of June, China has cut mortgage rates and pledged to support project completion. But banks have shown reluctance to throw good money after bad.Related stories:China’s property crisis burns middle class stuck with huge loansIn a policy document issued in July, Beijing said local governments will be primarily responsible for tackling rotten-tail homes.

The property sector, which accounts for about a quarter of China's economy, has lurched from crisis to crisis since the summer of 2020 after regulators stepped in to cut excess leverage, causing some developers to default on their debts and struggle to complete projects, resulting in homebuyers threatening to stop making payments.In August, 69 out of 100 cities reported a fall in monthly prices, the most since February 2020, according to the China Index Academy on Thursday, one of China's largest independent real estate research firms. More than 47 cities had reported a fall in prices in July.New home prices in the 100 cities fell slightly by 0.01 per cent from a month earlier, unchanged from July, said the academy, reflecting the continued chill in the property market.Home prices in tier-one cities including Beijing and Shanghai fell 0.08 per cent, after a 0.16 per cent fall in July.Analysts say the weakening prices will continue to hit homebuyer confidence, prolonging the property downturn and suggesting a further loss in economic momentum in a year when President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a precedent-breaking third term as China's leader. Responding to the problems in the property sector, China will support genuine demand for housing, state media quoted the cabinet as saying on Wednesday, after a meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang.""Local governments should have 'one policy for one city' to make good use of policy tools,"" and special loans should be used flexibly to ensure delivery of homes, state media reported. Local governments are expected to roll out more easing policy measures to boost credit demand, such as further reducing maximum downpayments and lowering mortgage rates, said the China Index Academy.The country's central bank last week cut a mortgage rate for home buyers to boost credit demand.""Beijing may need to consider a more comprehensive solution in its effort to resolve the property market predicament,"" economists at Nomura said in a note after the rate cut. ""However, there is a limited likelihood that such a solution will be reached before end-2022.""

The letter is one of the first known efforts by developers joining together to push back against a spreading revolt by homebuyers, who have threatened to stop paying mortgages on hundreds of unfinished housing projects.A growing debt crisis in the real estate sector has led to numerous defaults by developers following government moves to deleverage the sector, leading to projects stalling and raising risks to social instability.In a letter to the local government of Hefei dated August 2, the developers said it has become a norm for clients to protest during the course of home delivery, or even in earlier stages when a new development was launched.Developers said the protests included requesting changes in aspects or design of the whole development according to their own liking, refusing to pay service fees and asking for huge compensation when there were small issues with home quality.""Property developers now not only need to face their own internal pressure, but also unreasonable complaints and protests from some homebuyers,"" the letter said.They urged the local government to crack down on these type of ""professional protests"", ban unreasonable posts on the internet and punish ""self-media"" who published fake reports.""Government should carefully consider homebuyers' demand; (if) there is any inclination (in measures), it will lead to a chain effect and trigger large volume of illegal protests, resulting in bigger social conflict.""One of the developers, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters local authorities had stepped in after the letter, holding meetings with individual developers and protesters. The letter showed the company chops, or stamps, of more than 17 developers including local units of major firms such as state-backed China Resources Land and Beijing-based Longfor Group. China Resources Land, Longfor Group and the Hefei government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In an effort to stabilize slumping sales in the property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the country's economy, local governments have rolled out hundreds of stimulus measures including relaxed downpayment rules for home purchases and lower mortgage rates.

(File photo: AFP/Noel Celis) 26 Jul 2022 09:49AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn China’s deepening property bust is sending shock waves through the nation’s 400-million-strong middle class, upending the belief that real estate is a surefire way to build wealth.Now, as property developments stall across the country and house prices fall, many Chinese homeowners are slashing spending, postponing marriage and other life decisions, and, in a growing number of cases, withholding mortgage payments on unfinished homes.Peter, for one, has given up on starting his own business and buying a BMW 5 series after construction on his 2 million yuan (US$300,000) home in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, was halted by China Aoyuan Group. He is now saddled with a mortgage that’s eating up 90 per cent of his disposable income on a home he may never see.“I know every investment comes with a risk and you pay the price for your own choices,” Peter said, asking not to have his full name or any personal details used for fear of reprisal. “But homeowners aren’t the ones to blame and shouldn’t bear the consequences.”Peter is one of the hundreds of thousands of homebuyers in more than 90 cities across China to boycott a combined 2 trillion yuan in mortgages after firms such as Aoyuan and China Evergrande Group halted projects. A growing number of the nation’s middle class, which has an estimated 70 per cent of its collective wealth tied up in housing, are joining the wildcat actions to refuse payment, posing a threat to the economy and social stability. Related:China Evergrande CEO, CFO step down after probe into property services unitChinese authorities are now rushing to defuse the situation, with some proposing a grace period on loan payments and for local governments and banks to step in and rescue the developments. Construction halts may affect 4.7 trillion yuan worth of homes in China, and up to 1.4 trillion yuan, or about 1.3 per cent of the nation’s gross domestic product, may be needed to complete them, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kristy Hung estimated.UNIQUE MARKETChina’s housing market is unique in the prevalence of new homes being sold before they are built, with mortgage payments starting immediately after the initial deposit. This presale cash helped fuel a housing boom by allowing developers to begin new projects.While halted real estate projects are not unheard of in China, the depth of the current turmoil is unprecedented. It comes as the economy slows after more than two years of rolling COVID-19 lockdowns and a sweeping crackdown on the private sector in the name of “common prosperity” by President Xi Jinping has pushed youth unemployment to record highs.Related:Home prices have slid for 10 consecutive months, while disposable income per capita growth shrank for the fifth straight quarter at the end of June. It follows a debt boom over the past decade, which saw China’s household leverage rise to 61.6 per cent of its gross domestic product at the end of 2021 from 27.8 per cent at the end of 2011. Still, it’s relatively low compared with major economies like the United States and Japan.Hong Hao, a former China strategist at Bocom International Holdings, said the mortgage refusals will suppress house prices and sales, creating a negative wealth effect that will ripple through the economy. “I don’t think it’s a good bet,” Hong said of the property market. “Many have gotten used to thinking home prices will never fall. But a paradigm shift is here.”Andy Xie, a Shanghai-based independent economist, said the long property cycle had turned.“The high and rising prices were justified on growth, that is, one day income will catch up,” Xie said. “That is no more.”Related:Commentary: Property crisis presents China with a dilemmaIn China, where disposable income per capita is just a fraction of that in the US, it often takes years of savings to afford an apartment, which normally costs a few million yuan in main urban centers. Young couples typically rely on parents and grandparents to help finance purchases - the so-called “six wallets”. Li, a technology firm worker who has taken a 25 per cent pay cut this year, now uses a third of his salary to make a monthly 4,000 yuan mortgage payment on a stalled Evergrande development in Wuhan. This month, he joined about 5,000 others in a boycott to push the local government and the developer to restart construction on the project, which is supposed to house 39 residential skyscrapers. The 26-year-old says he’s “terrified” about his prospects and is afraid to start a relationship because he’s unsure he will own property - seen as a requirement for marriage.LEGAL REMEDIESHomebuyers are also looking at legal remedies, particularly against banks. Several preceding court rulings were in favour of buyers, nullifying their home purchase contracts and ordering the developers to return down payments and repay the remaining mortgages to banks instead. Guo, the buyer of an Evergrande project in Henan, has sued his bank after the project was halted last year and his lender failed to transfer the funds intended for construction into an escrow account.“It’s the escrow bank and developer that violated the laws, why should home buyers pay the price?” he said. Peter’s bank also failed to transfer money into an escrow account that was supposed to backstop the project, giving the developer free rein to use the funds, he and other home buyers claimed in their mortgage boycott letter.Evergrande and Aoyuan didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment.Not all people are willing to protest or pressure local governments. Tom, who in 2021 bought into an Evergrande project in Jingdezhen, has no plans to stop mortgage payments or join protests for fear it could hurt his credit rating. He’s confident the local government will ensure the project’s completion. But many buyers, in particular the elderly, don’t have the luxury to wait. Liu, a retiree in Jingdezhen, couldn’t qualify for a bank loan and used his life savings of about 800,000 yuan on an apartment with an elevator. He has made two visits to the construction site and found no sign of activity.“The best we can hope for is that the government can fix it,” said Liu, who lives on a pension of about 3,500 yuan a month. “But let’s be honest, even that seems like a forlorn hope.” Source: Bloomberg/rc Related Topics China property Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

An effort to short-circuit the spread of mortgage boycotts risks fuelling exactly the behavior it is trying to prevent.Authorities had little choice but to do something, given the rising market alarm, and their intervention sparked a relief rally in property and bank stocks on Monday (Jul 18). Whether this marks a turning point or merely a pause before the next leg down in the real estate crisis remains to be seen.The figures, on the face of things, suggest limited cause for concern. Affected loans amount to less than 0.01 per cent of outstanding residential mortgages at most Chinese banks, according to Fitch Ratings.As much as 2 trillion yuan (US$297 billion) of advances could be impacted, Bloomberg News reported GF Securities Co as saying. Even that, which is a measure of assets rather than potential losses, is barely 5 per cent of China’s 38.8 trillion yuan of total outstanding mortgages.If every buyer defaulted it would lead to a 388 billion yuan increase in nonperforming loans, Jefferies estimates.LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN HOUSING MARKET MIGHT INFECT FINANCIAL SYSTEMThat’s not to say the angst is misplaced. Anything but. After more than two years of living with the pandemic, everyone is more familiar with the implications of exponential growth rates.The mortgage boycott started in late June with a single China Evergrande Group project in the city of Jingdezhen. That became 28, then 58, then at least 100 developments in more than 50 cities by Jul 13. As of Sunday, the tally was at least 301 projects in about 91 cities.Capital Economics estimates that construction has been halted on around 13 million apartments in the past year, potentially affecting more than 4 trillion yuan in mortgage debt. Even if all this could be backstopped, there is no telling how such a loss of confidence might mutate and infect other parts of the financial system.Just as troubling is the emergence of such non-payment tactics in the first place, a strain of behaviour hitherto unknown in China. The country has long been assumed to be immune from the type of self-feeding mortgage spiral that drove the United States subprime crisis. When you’re a fruit picker loaned 50 times your salary to buy a US$750,000 house with no money down, it’s little trouble to walk away if the market turns south.The Chinese property market is a very different animal, with first-time buyers required to front 30 per cent of the purchase price, at least until regulations were relaxed earlier this year. When homeowners are laying out that much of their wealth to obtain a loan, it takes something catastrophic to get them to give up.In Hong Kong, which had similarly onerous downpayment rules prior to the Asian financial crisis, mortgage defaults stayed low even as home prices slumped by more than 60 per cent starting in late 1997, with the delinquency rate peaking at 1.43 per cent in 2001.Related:Commentary: Hong Kong’s IPO market lags behind other exchangesCommentary: The gap between Singapore and Hong Kong as financial hubs is narrowingIn China’s second-tier cities, where the mortgage boycotts have been concentrated, prices of newly built homes are showing nothing like that scale of decline, though the trend is clearly negative.PROPERTY THE MOST IMPORTANT STORE OF WEALTH FOR CHINESE OWNERSOf course, the concern for the mortgage strikers isn’t the falling value of their investment but whether they will receive what they’ve paid for at all. With a record wave of developer defaults and home sales stuck in a prolonged slump, that’s a tangible fear. It’s hard to blame them for taking such a hardball approach.Beyond the desire to cut their losses or put pressure on property companies to deliver, some buyers may have their own cash-flow problems amid the economic downturn, said David Qu, a Hong Kong-based economist with Bloomberg Economics.The wider behavioral consequences of the homebuyers’ revolt can only be guessed at. Property is by far the most important store of wealth for most Chinese owners and is central to the unwritten social contract that the Communist Party will guarantee ever-rising living standards in return for acquiescence to its rule.In the past, homeowners who bought in the earlier batches of a new project have been known to turn up and trash the sales office after the developer cuts prices for later tranches.This is the paradox of this latest rescue measure. The financial distress afflicting the property market is a result of the government’s attempt to impose greater market discipline on developers and arrest the relentless buildup of leverage.Even if the victims may be deserving this time, intervention keeps China locked into a pattern of protecting investors from the consequences of market failure. That’s probably still better than letting their faith in the system implode.Related:Commentary: Evergrande woes show China’s overreliance on property market for growth Source: Bloomberg/el Related Topics China Housing property Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

A rapidly spreading protest — borrowers refusing to make mortgage payments on unfinished homes — threatens to rattle the Chinese financial system, says Bloomberg’s Shuli Ren. An aerial view shows an Evergrande new housing development project under construction in Beijing, Wednesday, Sept. 22, 2021. (AP Photo) Shuli Ren Shuli Ren 16 Jul 2022 06:00AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG: It is spreading like wildfire. Homebuyers in China are refusing to pay the mortgage on properties they’ve bought but that their financially strapped developers can’t finish. Some say that they will only resume payments when construction restarts.The protest involved more than 100 delayed projects as of Wednesday (Jul 13), up from 58 projects just one day earlier. The frustrated buyers accuse the developers of misusing sales proceeds and the banks of failing to safeguard their loans.China has never seen anything like this. As in the United States — until the 2007 subprime crisis — the possibility of troubles in the mortgage market was vanishingly small. But this mortgage strike isn’t entirely unpredictable. Homebuyers have every reason to be angry. Most of the projects were begun by developers who have defaulted. China Evergrande Group led the pack, accounting for an estimated 35 per cent of the total projects that faced mortgage revolts, data compiled by CLSA shows. One such project in eastern Jiangsu province was launched before the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction has been suspended since August 2021, while property values in its neighborhood has come down by about 10 per cent.In other words, not only did the affected households see their wealth dip, they can’t move in and enjoy their new apartments either. THREAT TO STABILITY OF CHINESE BANKSOver the years, with consent of local governments, the likes of Evergrande and Country Garden Holdings Co fed the residential housing boom through a so-called pre-sales model: Apartments are bought long before they are completed. Now the builders don’t have money to finish these projects.Granted, developers’ debt woes were met with protests in the past, from suppliers, employees, all the way to hapless retail investors who had bought their wealth management offerings. But this new development is something entirely different. It opens a Pandora’s box and poses direct threat to the stability of Chinese banks. The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development met with financial regulators and major banks this week to discuss the mortgage boycotts, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.Unless Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government stops this stampede, a collapse of the banking system on the scale of Lehman Brothers Holdings in 2008 is very much in the cards. China is unprepared for such a big chunk of its bank loans to go sour. According to Autonomous Research, banks have about 62 trillion yuan (US$9.2 trillion) of exposure to the property sector. More than half is in the form of mortgage loans. At China Construction Bank Corp, one of the world’s largest banks, mortgages account for more than 20 per cent of its total assets.EVERGRANDE AND PROPERTY DEVELOPERS IN DISTRESS FOR QUITE SOME TIMEUntil this week, China’s middle class were excellent customers, dutifully paying their monthly bills. The government’s social credit system — a national credit rating and borrowing blacklist — has worked well; bad credit can even hamper one’s ability to take high-speed rails. But what if some are just fed up and willing to walk away from their obligations? Related:Commentary: Is there a housing bubble in China's real estate sector?Commentary: Evergrande woes show China’s overreliance on property market for growthWe’re not talking about one or two delinquent developers. In the past year, 28 of the top 100 developers have defaulted or asked their debtholders for extensions, data compiled by CLSA shows. Collectively, they account for about 20 per cent of China’s total property sales. Money is even tighter now. In the first half, property sales plummeted 72 per cent from a year ago, further eroding their cash flow.A CLSA monthly survey on the current status of Evergrande projects gives us a glimpse of how many unfinished sites there are across China. As of June, over half of Evergrande’s projects were under construction halts. The broker reckons that about 840 billion yuan in mortgages are tied to abandoned sites across China.It is worth asking how we even managed to get to this point, especially for a government that is obsessed with stability.All we have seen is policy inertia. Developers have been in distress for more than a year now, but there has been no progress in restructuring their finances. Local officials have been unwilling to make difficult decisions, write off bad debt and reach resolutions. Unable to shed financial burdens, builders can’t focus on operations. They become zombies, and their construction sites turn into ghost towns.In 2008, I worked at Lehman Brothers in New York and witnessed first-hand how the subprime mortgage crisis dragged down the venerable bank — and threatened the entire industry. This environment is starting to feel eerily similar.Related:Commentary: Evergrande’s troubles show China is susceptible to capitalism’s ill effects Source: Bloomberg/ch Related Topics China China Evergrande bank property loan Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

Managing China's real estate market involves a precarious balancing act. Getting it wrong could be costly, says a Chinese economist. Chinese real estate developer Evergrande is under a mountain of debt and has struggled to repay bondholders and investors. (File photo: AFP/Hector Retamal) Yu Yongding Yu Yongding 21 Mar 2022 06:07AM (Updated: 21 Mar 2022 10:51AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING: Despite strong global economic headwinds, not least from the COVID-19 pandemic, China managed to achieve 8.1 per cent GDP growth last year, its highest rate in a decade. With that, China met the International Monetary Fund’s expectations and far surpassed its own government’s 6 per cent target.But China’s economic performance is not quite as strong as it may seem, and not only because year-on-year growth figures were flattered by the pandemic-induced trough in 2020 when the growth rate slowed sharply to just 2.3 per cent. China’s growth momentum was much weaker in the second half of the year (4 per cent growth, year on year) than in the first half (12.7 per cent), owing largely to the government’s efforts to rein in the real estate sector.SKYROCKETING HOUSING PRICESChina has good reason to be vigilant. Housing prices have roughly tripled over the past 20 years, with the ratio of home prices to annual income now averaging 43.15 in Shenzhen, 42.47 in Beijing, and 33.36 in Shanghai, compared to 13.37 in London and 8.76 in New York City. This partly reflects the misallocation of resources: China has built too many skyscrapers, luxury hotels, and high-end apartments and not nearly enough affordable housing. Speculation is also a concern.In order to stabilise housing prices, force real estate developers to deleverage and reduce commercial banks’ exposure to the sector, the government introduced three major policy measures, which began to take effect in 2021. The first was the imposition of “three red lines” for developers. In August 2020, China’s government declared that a few large developers could not have a liability-to-asset ratio of more than 70 per cent, a net gearing ratio of more than 100 per cent or a cash-to-short-term-debt ratio of more than 100 per cent.Last year, these red lines were applied to the entire real estate sector. If crossed, regulators will impose tighter debt limits on developers.China also introduced new caps on banks’ lending exposure to the real estate sector. For the big state-owned commercial banks, property lending cannot exceed 40 per cent of the total, and mortgage lending is capped at 32.5 per cent. Limits for smaller banks are determined by regulators based on size.Lastly, China overhauled how local governments sell rights to land. It is hoped that a limited number of centralised auctions will help to force down prices.These measures go a long way toward explaining why the cumulative growth rate of real estate finance plunged from 54.2 per cent in January 2021 to 4.2 per cent in December. Over the same period, the cumulative growth rate of total house sales dropped from 133.4 per cent to 4.8 per cent in terms of square meters, and from 104.9 per cent to 1.9 per cent in terms of value. As a result, the cumulative growth rate of investment in real-estate development in China fell from 38.3 per cent to 4.4 per cent – a sharp decline, even taking the base effect into account.Not surprisingly, because of the large share of real estate investment, total investment growth also plummeted in 2021, from 35 per cent in January to 4.9 per cent in December. This does not bode well for China’s economic growth. INVESTMENTS IN THE HOUSING MARKETAlthough investment’s contribution to GDP growth has decreased significantly since 2010, it remains important. Investment demand played a key role in fuelling the economic recovery early last year. China is eyeing strict management of local debt and increased housing reform as part of moves to shore up growth in the world's second-largest economy. (Source: AFP/Greg Baker) In fact, according to a 2020 World Bank report, the share of housing-related activities in both fixed-asset investment and GDP in China today far exceeds the levels in the United States at the peak of its housing boom in 2006. That is why, when GDP growth declined in the third quarter of 2021, China’s government tweaked its policies to curb excessive borrowing by property developers.China’s government has emphasised that policies to address financial vulnerabilities and structural problems should not impede economic growth. But, when it comes to the real estate sector, that will not be an easy balance to strike – and, given the economy’s reliance on real estate, getting it wrong could have serious repercussions.China’s government should have adopted a more expansionary fiscal and monetary policy last year to boost overall growth. It should have made more efforts to boost growth in infrastructure investment as well, to offset the negative impact of the slowdown of real estate investment on economic growth. In fact, infrastructure investment grew by a measly 0.4 per cent last year, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2020.The good news is that China’s government recently announced that stabilising growth is its top priority. China has ample room for implementing expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Markets are confident that China will be able to achieve a growth rate of 5.5 per cent in 2022. With that, one hopes that the country’s lacklustre GDP growth, which has continued for more than a decade, will finally end.Yu Yongding is a former President of the China Society of World Economics and Director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He also served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the People’s Bank of China from 2004 to 2006.

Home prices have remained high in large cities, despite a big downturn for the country's highly indebted real estate sector. Of 3 million square metres of new rental land offered for development this year, 2.33 million square metres will be for low-cost rental housing, the Beijing government said, the equivalent of more than 320 soccer fields. In total, Beijing will supply 10.6 million square metres of land for homes this year, unchanged from 2021, including 7.6 million square metres of homes for commercial sales, according to a notice published by Beijing's Natural Resources planner.China's new home prices rose for the first time since September on a monthly basis, official data for January showed last week, partly supported by improved demand in big cities.China aims to supply 6.5 million new low-cost rental homes in 40 major cities in 2021-2025.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 25 Feb 2022 12:08PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING : Shaken by a liquidity crunch among developers, China's property market is expected to stay soft in the first half of 2022 before rebounding later in the year as policies aimed at encouraging buyers helps sentiment recover, a Reuters poll showed.Having been a pillar of strength for the world's second largest economy, the heavily indebted property sector faltered last year as Beijing mounted a deleveraging campaign that caught out several major developers, disrupting project deliveries and chilling buyer sentiment.Aside from struggling with a rapidly cooling property sector, China has also encountered sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks that could deal a blow to factory output and consumption.Average home prices are estimated to fall 1.0per cent on year in the first half, according a Reuters survey of 17 analysts and economists conducted between Feb. 16-23. The estimate was unchanged from that of a Reuters poll in November.For the full year, home prices are expected to rise 2.0per cent.""Home prices are likely to rise if curbs are relaxed,"" said Li Qilin, chief economist at Hongta Securities, adding the credit environment and regulatory policies on real estate have marginally eased since the beginning of this year.""Property transactions in first- and second-tier cities, supported by their economic and demographic advantages, will be remarkably better than third- and fourth-tier cities.""Authorities have unveiled a slew of measures to boost sales and sentiment, including giving developers easier access to escrowed pre-sale funds, requiring smaller down-payments for first-time home buyers, and allowing commercial banks to lower mortgage rates.Analysts are more upbeat on housing demand and supply than in the last Reuters survey, though they said sentiment has not fully recovered and real estate firms still face financing pressure.For demand, property sales are seen slumping 14.0per cent in the first half, narrowing from a 16.0per cent fall in November's poll. Sales are expected to decline 7.5per cent for the full year.Many respondents said policies regulating demand, especially genuine demand, will be loosened, but for now sellers were relying on offering discounts.""Home buyers' confidence has not yet been restored, and discounts are still a key marketing tool,"" Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, a Beijing-based property research institute.""First- and second-tier cities will see an increase in the scale of new home transactions, driving a structural rise in nationwide home prices.""China's housing minister on Thursday pledged to keep the real estate market stable this year and ensure genuine demand for homes is met.Investment by real estate firms is expected to fall 2.0per cent in the first half and gain 1.5per cent for the whole year. Reuters previously forecast investment would drop 3.0per cent in the first half of 2022. Property investment grew 4.4per cent in 2021, the slowest pace in 17 months, while real estate firms' sales by area rose 1.9per cent.""Real estate companies with capital pressure will move cautiously on land purchases and property investment,"" said Lu Wenxi, chief analyst with property agency Centaline.Daniel Yao, head of research for China at JLL, a commercial property services provider, expected authorities to issue more loans to property firms for project development and allow them to issue bonds more easily to relieve the liquidity pressure and stabilise the outlook.Among the 17 respondents, 13 said China will delay rolling out a real estate tax pilot given the strain on its economy.

Picture taken January 14, 2022. REUTERS/Aly Song 27 Jan 2022 06:07PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING : China is counting on revived infrastructure spending to support its slowing economy, but controls over local government debt risks and falling investment returns could hamper the renewed push, policy insiders and economists said.As pressure grows from a deepening property market slump and the country's strict zero-COVID policy, Chinese leaders are once again turning to infrastructure to drive growth, after a year when they focused on curbing debt and housing risks.Stability trumps everything ahead of a key once-in-five-years Communist Party congress later this year, with policymakers looking to ward off a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy that could undermine job creation.At a meeting in December to chart the course for 2022, top leaders called for front loading infrastructure investment to help cushion the slowdown, which looks set to worsen in the first half. ""We need to step up infrastructure investment and stabilize the property sector,"" Yao Jingyuan, an adviser to the cabinet, told Reuters. ""The downward pressure on the economy is big this year and the employment pressure is big."" This month, Premier Li Keqiang pledged faster investment in 102 key infrastructure projects, including in transportation, logistics and telecommunications as well as advanced manufacturing and high-tech, under the country's the 14th five-year plan (2021-25).Local governments, meanwhile, have unveiled their own infrastructure projects, including in Shanghai and the provinces of Sichuan, Jiangsu，Zhejiang, Anhui and Hebei. However, any rush to launch such projects could reignite debt concerns, even as Beijing keeps checks on local government borrowing and requires sustainable investment returns.In 2008-2009, a 4 trillion yuan ($629 billion) spending package largely shielded China's economy from the global financial crisis but saddled local governments and state firms with mountains of debt.""We should try our best to reduce the side effects of economic stimulus policies,"" Yao said.LOOKING TO NEW AREASChina's fixed-asset investment grew 4.9per cent in 2021 from a year earlier, the second-weakest pace since 1996 when official data started. Growth was 2.9per cent in COVID-ravaged 2020.Infrastructure investment rose just 0.4per cent in 2021, though analysts at HSBC predict it will expand 5per cent this year as Beijing looks to ease financing bottlenecks and focuses on new growth drivers.With traditional projects like highways, railways and airports facing falling investment returns and reaching saturation point, China has been trying to expand new infrastructure focused on 5G, artificial intelligence, and data.The finance ministry has already issued 1.46 trillion yuan in its 2022 advance quota for local government special bonds, on top of 1.2 trillion yuan in unspent bond funds from the fourth quarter of 2021 - part of the 2021 quota of 3.65 trillion yuan.Vice Finance Minister Xu Hongcai said last month that the new quota will prioritise key projects and regions with lower debt burdens, while strictly controlling local governments’ hidden debt to fend off systemic risks.But after decades of break-neck construction and credit-fuelled investment, new projects may offer less economic bang for the buck.""The problem at the present is that we have enough money but don't have enough good projects,"" said a government adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. MOVING TO STABILIZE PROPERTY SECTORTo revive construction, authorities have been trying to restore stability to the ailing property sector, marginally easing financing curbs for property developers and speeding up mortgage issuance for home buyers.But few analysts expect a major turnaround in the sector soon, with HSBC forecasting zero to 2per cent growth in property investment this year.A ramp-up in public housing developments could also be on the cards. Such spending was often deployed during past downturns.Moreover, the central bank has started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system to bring borrowing costs down, with further modest easing steps expected in coming months.""We should not allow the property market to sink for a long time because it's related to many industries,"" Li Yang, former vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, told a media briefing last week. China will be able to achieve economic growth of around 5.5per cent in 2022, an adviser to the cabinet said last week, a rosier prediction than markets expect.The IMF this week forecast China's growth this year at 4.8per cent.""We expect Beijing to significantly speed up investment in national infrastructure projects, though the size is unlikely to be sufficient to stabilize growth,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note. Lu said China should move to spur consumption by ramping up subsidies for households during the pandemic.($1 = 6.3206 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Kim Coghill) Source: Reuters Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?

A correction by the central government is much needed,"" said Nan Li, associate professor of finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Chinese developers are allowed to sell residential projects before completing them but are required to put those funds in escrow accounts. The cash held in escrow typically accounts for 50per cent to 70per cent of developers' pre-sale funds, one of the people said, without giving an estimate on the amount held.Guided by the cabinet-level Financial stability and Development Committee, the sector's main regulator the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other authorities are drafting the new rules, three of the people said. Beijing aims to roll them out as early as end of January in a push to prevent a wider crisis, the people said.The Hang Seng Mainland Properties index rose 1.6per cent in afternoon trading after the Reuters report and ended nearly 6per cent higher on Wednesday. Chinese property developers Shimao Group Holdings, Sunac China Holdings and Country Garden Holdings led the sector's gains, closing up 11.3per cent, 7.6per cent and 8.3per cent, respectively.U.S. dollar bonds issued by developers including Sunac and Country Garden also rose following the report.The property sector accounts for about a quarter of China's economy, the world's second-largest after the United States. The State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development did not immediately respond to requests for comment.CASH CRUNCHMany local governments curbed withdrawals from the escrow accounts in 2021 amid fears of contagion after news of Evergrande's debt problems, leaving several projects across the country unfinished and worsening cash flow for developers.While some municipalities have eased withdrawal restrictions since late last year, one of the sources said that due to lack of nationwide rules on this front, local enforcement had already gone too far in several cities.The proposed new rules are aimed at allowing developers to use escrow funds to first complete unfinished buildings and then for other purposes, three of the sources said.The rules would also prioritise the repayment of onshore debt of developers with better credit profiles, the fourth source said.Nomura estimates that Chinese developers would need to meet onshore and offshore maturities of about 210 billion yuan ($33 billion) each in the first two quarters of 2022, compared with 191 billion yuan in the last quarter of 2021. In recent weeks, Beijing has taken steps to restore stability in the property sector including making it easier for state-backed developers to buy up distressed assets https://www.reuters.com/business/shimao-group-unit-talks-with-lender-missed-trust-loan-payment-2022-01-07/#:~:text=SHANGHAIper cent2FHONGper cent20KONGper cent2Cper cent20Janper cent207,liquidityper cent20crisisper cent20inper cent20theper cent20sector of indebted private firms, a source told Reuters this month.On Tuesday, a senior official at the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said the central bank would maintain ""continuity, consistency and stability"" of property financial policies.Property sales and financing are gradually returning to normal, and market expectations are improving, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the PBOC said.

What does this mean for China’s post-pandemic economic recovery and growth prospects?Take the energy crisis, which started when a rapid increase in exports – driven by the global recovery – fueled a sharp increase in demand for electricity. China remains dependent on coal for 56.8 per cent of its total electricity supply. And yet, in an effort to meet mandatory targets for reducing energy consumption, local governments have shut down many coal mines in recent years.At the same time, the government’s climate goals – to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 – discourage investment in the coal industry. Of course, these goals also encourage investment in renewables, which are a growing part of China’s energy mix. But renewables are nowhere near where they need to be to cover the current shortfall. As a result, when energy demand surged, so did coal prices. But, because China’s government regulates electricity prices, energy providers – most of which are state-owned enterprises – could not pass the costs onto customers. To limit the losses, they cut electricity supplies, thereby forcing some manufacturers to curtail production.Not surprisingly, the government sprang into action. It ordered a rapid expansion of some coal mines and the reopening of others. It gave utility companies more leeway in setting electricity prices. And it pushed manufacturers to boost energy efficiency and accelerate investment in renewable energy.How do electricity companies balance rising electricity prices with carbon emissions reductions commitments in Singapore? Listen to CNA's The Climate Conversations:Related:Commentary: China’s energy crisis shows just how hard it will be to reach net-zero emissionsChina will quickly overcome the power shortages, which are already becoming less acute. But developing a more resilient, sustainable energy sector will take time.And if each step of the development is not carefully planned and implemented, this transition could weigh on economic growth.THREAT OF EVERGRANDE COLLAPSEThe Evergrande crisis, too, poses serious risks to growth. Over the years, owing to defective corporate governance, the developer expanded at a frantic pace, not only through its real estate investments, but also by diversifying into the electric vehicle industry. To fund its activities, it borrowed heavily from both commercial banks and capital markets, including issuing dollar bonds to foreign investors. Ultimately, it racked up some 800 billion yuan (US$124 billion) in debt. Though Evergrande has more than 1.85 trillion yuan in assets, it has not been able to sell them fast enough. Last month, when the company admitted that it is unlikely to be able to service its debts, rumors of an impending collapse – and a potential Chinese financial crisis – began to swirl.Yet fears seem largely to be overblown. To be sure, it would be unwise to predict Evergrande’s fate at this point. But it is probably safe to assume that the debacle does not pose a systemic threat to China’s financial sector.Pundits have been predicting since 2012 that a housing market collapse would trigger a financial crisis in China. Related:Commentary: Climate disaster may be the common enemy US and China needCommentary: Evergrande woes could spread to Southeast Asia property markets and construction suppliersCommentary: Evergrande’s troubles show China is susceptible to capitalism’s ill effectsBut in Evergrande’s case, the problem is liquidity, not solvency. And any spillover effects can be contained, not least because, despite its issues, China’s banking system is basically healthy. Real estate developers and home buyers account for only about 30 per cent of total bank loans, and that share is falling. The share of new loans that are real estate-related is also on the decline, having dropped from 45 per cent in 2016 to less than 24 per cent in September 2020.Moreover, in China, there are no subprime loans, and virtually no securitised mortgage loans. More importantly, there are very few cases of delinquency, let alone mortgage defaults by households: Most Chinese commercial banks’ non-performing loan ratio is less than 2 per cent. Even if there were a major financial event, the Chinese government has enough instruments to deal with it.So, like China’s energy crisis, the Evergrande debacle does not pose an imminent systemic risk. But that does not mean policymakers should be complacent. The real estate sector is a pillar of the Chinese economy and an important link in the production chain. And Evergrande’s collapse would severely disrupt it – not least because a few other large real estate developers might follow in Evergrande’s footsteps. Some non-bank financial institutions would also be in trouble. And, of course, Evergrande’s suppliers would suffer enormously. All of this would worsen China’s economic prospects.Related:Commentary: China has always been a nanny state but does it really know best?Commentary: Is China’s economic growth model superior and worth copying?CHINA’S PRIORITY TO END GROWTH SLOWDOWNTo prepare for what may come, financial system vulnerabilities, especially the corporate sector’s high leverage ratio, must be addressed. But the first priority must be to end the persistent growth slowdown, which began in 2010. This trend is at least as worrying as the short-term structural problems that have grabbed headlines lately. China’s experience over the past 40 years shows that without decent growth, financial stability is difficult to achieve.This pattern is borne out by recently released official statistics indicating that China’s annual growth rate was a lower-than-expected 4.9 per cent in the third quarter of this year, and it is widely feared that the growth rate in the fourth quarter may be even lower. To counter that possibility, Chinese policymakers need to pursue bolder fiscal and monetary expansion, alongside structural reform and adjustment.Yu Yongding is a former president of the China Society of World Economics and director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the People’s Bank of China from 2004 to 2006.

Residential buildings from a housing complex developed by Evergrande Group, in Luoyang, China September 16, 2021. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Kenneth Rogoff Kenneth Rogoff 30 Sep 2021 03:28PM (Updated: 09 Nov 2021 03:13PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts: The impending bankruptcy of Chinese real estate giant Evergrande, with its US$300 billion in debt, has roiled global investors. Analysts have focused mainly on whether the Chinese government will succeed in ring-fencing the problem, so that it does not spill over into a broader Western-style financial crisis. Given the government’s deep pockets, including over US$3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, and its ability to dictate restructuring terms without long court delays, few would bet against such an outcome. But concentrating only on near-term financial stability misses China’s larger challenge: rebalancing an economy that has depended for far too long on its massive real estate investment sector for jobs and growth.CHINA PROPERTY MARKET'S OUTSIZED SHAREThe outsized share of real estate and related services in Chinese gross domestic product - a staggering 25 per cent, and only slightly less after adjusting for net exports - is even larger than the property sector’s share of the Spanish and Irish economies at its pre-2008 peak. Because of its knock-on effects on other sectors, a significant slowdown in China’s real estate sector could easily cut 5 to 10 per cent from cumulative GDP growth over the ensuing few years. FILE PHOTO: Evergrande Center in Shanghai, China, September 24, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Moreover, real estate is by far the most important savings vehicle in an economy where capital controls constrain citizens’ ability to invest abroad. Any significant decline in real estate prices would lead not only to widespread disaffection, but also to a potentially significant pullback in consumption of other goods and services.Can’t the Chinese real estate machine just keep running full speed ahead, given the need to house the country’s 1.4 billion people? Maybe. But China has been rapidly building houses and apartment buildings for decades, not just in its top-tier cities but also in less-desired third- and fourth-tier cities, where prices are much lower and vacancy rates are high.As a result, China’s total housing supply, measured in square metres per person, has already reached the levels of much wealthier economies such as Germany and France. A SLOW CONTROLLED DEFLATION IN CHINA?Although average housing quality in China is lower and there is potential to upgrade, the massive current level of real estate production has to be unsustainable. With the housing vacancy rate in urban China now at 21 per cent, the authorities fully understand the need to shift productive resources into other sectors.But engineering a slow, controlled deflation of China’s real estate bubble will not be easy. Related:Commentary: China’s leaders risk a dangerous miscalculation with EvergrandeCommentary: Xi Jinping’s ‘common prosperity’ looks more like populism rather than socialismWith the banking sector having lent heavily to residential projects - Evergrande alone has borrowed from almost 300 banks and financial firms - a sharp drop in housing prices could prove painful and cascade catastrophically into other sectors. In principle, banks are protected by substantial down payments, often amounting to 30 per cent or more of the purchase price. But given China’s epic house-price boom in the 21st century, 30 per cent may prove not nearly enough when a collapse comes. After the 2008 financial crisis, housing prices in the United States dropped by 36 per cent, and by significantly more in some regions.Besides, making housing more affordable has been an important goal of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government, so there are limits to how much one can expect policymakers to prop up prices.Many believe that the Evergrande housing crisis is part of the government’s general squeeze on the Chinese elite, which has included taking down Internet giants, making it more difficult for wealthy parents to get private tutoring for their children, and insisting that firms give back much more to their communities.According to this line of thinking, policymakers can always recalibrate if their efforts to rein in housing debt, and Evergrande in particular, prove too destabilising. But as the government is well aware, this risks making the eventual reversal of the real estate and construction boom all the more painful.AMPLIFYING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN CHINAReal estate slowdowns, even real estate-related financial crises, do not tend to happen on their own, but rather in the context of a slowing economy. The Chinese economy came roaring out of the pandemic, and for a while was the envy of the world, thanks in part to the government’s COVID-zero strategy.Related:Commentary: Evergrande woes could spread to Southeast Asia property markets and construction suppliersCommentary: Maybe there is no such thing as too many BTO flats?But the future looks much less rosy. In addition to headwinds from an ageing population and slowing productivity growth, the Delta variant is proving far more difficult to contain.On top of all that, the almost daily rash of new government decrees has made it exceedingly difficult for the private sector to plan ahead.The resulting policy uncertainty would put a damper on growth even without the other issues. In such an environment, a housing market slowdown can significantly amplify any economic downturn.After nearly four decades of extraordinary economic expansion, one should not underestimate the Chinese authorities’ ability to maintain growth despite all obstacles. Nevertheless, as impressive as China has been at building roads, bridges, and houses, its real estate construction boom is coming to an end, and there is no reason to expect a smooth landing.Chinese financial regulators may yet succeed in insulating the broader market from the Evergrande crisis and convincing everyone that this is an anomalous case. But given China’s decades-long overreliance on the real estate sector for growth, particularly during general downturns, the biggest challenges may be yet to come.Kenneth Rogoff is a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University.

(Photo: AP/Ng Han Guan) Stephen S Roach Stephen S Roach 29 Sep 2021 04:25PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn NEW HAVEN, Connecticut: All eyes are fixed on the dark side of China. We have been here before.Starting with the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and continuing through the dot-com recession of the early 2000s and the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, China was invariably portrayed as the next to fall.Yet time and again, the Chinese economy defied gloomy predictions with a resilience that took most observers by surprise.Count me among the few who were not surprised that past alarms turned out to be false. But count me in when it comes to sensing that this time feels different.IS EVERGRANDE THE PROBLEM?Contrary to most, however, I do not think Evergrande Group is the problem, or even the catalytic tipping point.Yes, China’s second-largest property developer is in potentially fatal trouble. And yes, its debt overhang of some US$300 billion poses broader risks to the Chinese financial system, with potential knock-on effects in global markets.But the magnitude of those ripple effects is likely to be far less than those who loudly proclaim that Evergrande is China’s Lehman Brothers, suggesting that another “Minsky Moment” may well be at hand.Three considerations argue to the contrary. First, the Chinese government has ample resources to backstop Evergrande loan defaults and ring-fence potential spillovers to other assets and markets.With some US$7.5 trillion in domestic saving and another US$3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, China has more than enough capacity to absorb a worst-case Evergrande implosion. Recent large liquidity injections by the People’s Bank of China underscore the point.Second, Evergrande is not a classic “black swan” crisis, but rather a conscious and deliberate consequence of Chinese policy aimed at deleveraging, de-risking, and preserving financial stability.In particular, China has made good progress reducing shadow banking activity in recent years, thereby limiting the potential for deleveraging contagion to infect other segments of its financial markets.Unlike Lehman and its devastating collateral damage, the Evergrande problem hasn’t blindsided Chinese policymakers. Third, risks to the real economy, which has entered a temporary soft patch, are limited. The demand side of the Chinese property market is well supported by the ongoing migration of rural workers to cities.Related:Commentary: Beijing determined to make an example of crisis-hit EvergrandeCommentary: Evergrande woes could spread to Southeast Asia property markets and construction suppliersCommentary: Evergrande’s troubles show China is susceptible to capitalism’s ill effectsThis is very different from the collapse of speculative housing bubbles in other countries, like Japan and the United States, where supply overhangs were unsupported by demand.While the urban share of the Chinese population has now risen slightly above 60 per cent, there is still plenty of upside until it reaches the 80 to 85 per cent threshold typical of more advanced economies.Notwithstanding recent accounts of shrinking cities – reminiscent of earlier false alarms over a profusion of ghost cities – underlying demand for urban shelter remains firm, limiting downside risks to the overall economy, even in the face of an Evergrande failure.A MAJOR RETHINKING OF CHINA’S GROWTH MODELChina’s most serious problems are less about Evergrande and more about a major rethinking of its growth model.Initially, I worried about a regulatory clampdown, that the new measures in July took dead aim at China’s Internet platform companies, threatening to stifle the “animal spirits” in some of the economy’s most dynamic sectors, such as fintech, video gaming, online music, ride-sharing, private tutoring, and takeaway, delivery and lifestyle services.Related:Commentary: China has always been a nanny state but does it really know best?Commentary: Why I play online video games with my kids instead of banning them That was then. Now, the Chinese government has doubled down, with President Xi Jinping throwing the full force of his power into a “common prosperity” campaign aimed at addressing inequalities of income and wealth.Moreover, the regulatory net has been broadened, not just to ban cryptocurrencies, but also to become an instrument of social engineering, with the government adding electronic cigarettes, business drinking and celebrity fan culture to its ever-lengthening list of bad social habits.All this only compounds the concerns I had. The new dual thrust of Chinese policy – redistribution plus re-regulation – strikes at the heart of the market-based “reform and opening up” that have underpinned China’s growth miracle since the days of Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s.It will subdue the entrepreneurial activity that has been so important in powering China’s dynamic private sector, with lasting consequences for the next, innovations-driven, phase of Chinese economic development. Without animal spirits, the case for indigenous innovation is in tatters.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/Pool Related:Commentary: China is looking like a lonely superpowerSHARP MARKET REACTIONSWith Evergrande blowing up in the aftermath of this sea change in Chinese policy, financial markets, understandably, have reacted sharply. The government has been quick to counter the backlash.Vice-premier Liu He, China’s leading architect of economic strategy and a truly outstanding macro thinker, was quick to reaffirm the government’s unwavering support for private enterprise.Capital markets regulators have likewise stressed further “opening up” via new connectivity initiatives between onshore and offshore markets. Other regulators have reaffirmed China’s steadfast intention to stay the course. Perhaps they doth protest too much?Of course, on one level, who wouldn’t want common prosperity? US President Joe Biden’s US$3.5 trillion “Build Back Better” agenda smacks of many of the same objectives.Tackling inequality and a social agenda at the same time is a big deal for any country. It is not only the subject of intense debate in Washington but also bears critically on China’s prospects.RUNNING COUNTER TO CHINA’S ECONOMIC STRATEGYThe problem for China is that its new approach runs counter to the thrust of many of its most powerful economic trends of the past four decades: Entrepreneurial activity, a thriving start-up culture, private sector dynamism and innovation.What I hear now from China is denial – siloed arguments that address each issue in isolation. Redistribution is discussed separately from the impact of new regulations.Related:Commentary: Didi’s troubles with China should be everyone’s businessCommentary: China's smackdown on corporate giants may be a start of national rebuildingAnd there is also a siloed approach to defending regulatory actions themselves – case-by-case arguments for strengthening oversight of internet platform companies, reducing social anxiety among stressed-out young people, and ensuring data security.As a macro practitioner, I was always taught to consider the combined effects of major developments. Evergrande will pass. Common prosperity is here to stay.A regulatory clampdown, in conjunction with a push to redistribute income and wealth, rewinds the movie of the Chinese miracle.By failing to connect the dots, China’s leaders risk a dangerous miscalculation.Stephen S Roach, a faculty member at Yale University and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is the author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China.

REUTERS/Thomas Suen 28 Sep 2021 07:14PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn HONG KONG : Beijing is prodding government-owned firms and state-backed property developers such as China Vanke Co Ltd to purchase some of embattled China Evergrande Group's assets, people with knowledge of the matter said.Evergrande, saddled with US$305 billion in liabilities, is teetering on the brink of collapse. But the central government is unlikely to intervene directly to resolve Evergrande's crisis in the form of a bailout, according to six people, including four in government and regulatory bodies.Authorities are hoping, however, that asset purchases will ward off or at least mitigate any social unrest that could occur if Evergrande were to suffer a messy collapse, they said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.A handful of government-owned enterprises have already done due diligence on assets in the southern Chinese city Guangzhou, said one person.In one emblematic example, Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group is close to acquiring Evergrande's Guangzhou FC Soccer stadium and surrounding residential projects, according to the person, who has direct knowledge of the matter.Set to cost around 12 billion yuan (US$1.9 billion), the stadium https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrandes-construction-guangzhou-soccer-stadium-proceeding-planned-2021-09-27 has been designed to seat more than 100,000, making it the world's largest venue built for soccer by capacity.Potential buyers of Evergrande's core assets in Guangzhou have been ""arranged"" with ""both political and commercial considerations"" in mind, the person said, adding that authorities don't want to see just a few companies bidding for the same assets.Evergrande and Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The state assets regulator, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Vanke and China Jinmao Holdings are among government-backed property developers that have been asked to purchase assets from Evergrande, sources said. China Resources Land has also been asked, one source said. Property developers and government-owned firms have been sounded out either directly or indirectly about asset purchases, the sources said. Reuters could not immediately ascertain the current status of most of those discussions.Vanke, which is one-third owned by Shenzhen's state-owned subway operator, said in August it has talked with Evergrande about cooperating on various projects. It did not respond on Tuesday to a request for comment on the status of those discussions. Jinmao and China Resources Land also did not respond to requests for comment.Evergrande missed paying US$83.5 million in interest to offshore bondholders last week and has a US$47.5 million coupon payment due on Wednesday. While expectations are high that it will undergo one of the largest-ever restructurings in China, government bodies have been largely silent on the potential for a bailout or how they might deal with a collapse.Beijing has, however, worked to curb any ricochet effect on the financial system from Evergrande’s troubles, with the central bank pledging on Monday to protect consumers exposed to the housing market and injecting more cash into the banking system.One of the first signs of an official inquiry into the real estate giant came this week when the Shenzhen government's financial regulator said an investigation had been opened https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-evergrandes-wealth-management-arm-faces-local-government-inquiry-2021-09-27 into an Evergrande wealth management unit. One person with direct knowledge of local government involvement said local governments have been asked to mediate with government-backed groups and companies so they can participate in Evergrande's reorganisation and asset sales.Any action taken by local governments will depend on the extent of Evergrande's presence in those areas and the local finances of that particular province or city, the sources also said.They added that regulators will first assess the funding situation of all Evergrande's businesses before taking any action on its liquidity situation.""What kind of committee should be set up is a second story; it depends on the debt situation,"" said one regulatory source.

Others are negotiating payment extensions with Evergrande, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private matters.It is not clear how much of the funds are in arrears and there is no evidence that trusts are passing payment delays on to customers who bought fixed-income products tied to Evergrande.Already, missed payments on 40 billion yuan (US$6.2 billion) of wealth products sold by Evergrande itself to retail investors have sparked nationwide protests, putting more pressure on Beijing to find a solution and avoid further unrest.Contagion into the US$3 trillion trust industry will put at risk many more investors, while also threatening the biggest source of non-bank funding for the property sector as shadow banks retreat. “The Chinese government will place social stability as one of the priorities,” said James Feng, the founding partner of Poseidon Capital Group, a Chinese fund that specialises in distressed and special situation investments.The clock is ticking for Evergrande to make these investors whole. The cash-strapped firm faces repayments in the fourth quarter on US$1.8 billion of high-yield products sold through trusts to wealthy clients and institutions. Another US$4 billion is due next year, according to data provider Use Trust.Related:A property titan in crisis: What went wrong at China’s Evergrande and what's nextThe Chinese government, concerned about preserving financial stability, has pushed Evergrande to meet its many obligations. In a recent meeting, regulators urged the company to complete unfinished housing projects and repay retail investors, while averting a default on its dollar bonds.Evergrande’s billionaire chairman Hui Ka Yan meanwhile told staff last week that buyers of its investment products will be repaid, the company said.Yet with more than US$300 billion in liabilities and cash flow shrinking, it is not clear how Hui can pull that off. The company already missed a Sep 23 deadline to make an US$83.5 million coupon payment on a US$2 billion bond maturing in March.The firm is also subject to heightened restrictions on its bank accounts as regulators ensure it uses cash to complete housing projects and not to pay creditors. The stock and bonds are reeling.Evergrande's 8.25 per cent bond due 2022 indicated down 0.5 cent on the dollar on Monday at 28.4 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. The stock rose 2.5 per cent in Hong Kong, paring its decline to 84 per cent this year.Evergrande’s dependence on trusts and other asset management products began growing after banks were directed to cut back on their lending to the property sector. By the end of 2019, Evergrande had done business with most of the 68 trust companies in China, which accounted for 41 per cent of its total financing, based on the last borrowing disclosure. In response to Evergrande’s financial troubles, the trust firms grew more cautious last year, with some accepting only one of dozens of proposals from the developer, often funding less than half the project value, the people said. Trusts are also reducing their exposure to other property firms, a sign that Evergrande’s woes threaten the entire real estate industry, which accounts for more than 15 per cent of China’s economy. The trusts have cut outstanding loans to property firms by 201 billion yuan in the first half of this year, a drop of 17 per cent, according to the trust association.Despite this, trusts remain Evergrande’s biggest source of direct debt, outweighing bank borrowings and bonds, said Christopher Yip, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings. “They are also the biggest trust borrower in the property sector.”When trusts began pulling back, the developer started squeezing money from more murky sources - selling its own high-yield wealth products to staff, homebuyers and others.The money was not raised in Evergrande’s name to side-step regulations and keep borrowings off its books, leaving some analysts to speculate on whether there are hidden obligations that are yet to surface.Evergrande did not shy away from aggressive sales tactics. As the stock and bonds began to crater this year, it sent out a clear directive to employees: Find buyers for the company’s high-yield investment funds or your job could be at risk. Many staff complied, not only buying the products for themselves, but encouraging friends and family to do the same.An employee promotion sent to workers in Liaoning province in July had these investment goals: 100,000 yuan (US$15,000) per employee, up to 10 times that for executives.Managers would be rewarded - or fined - based on meeting the targets, and the purchases would be “important evidence” of performance, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg News.

(Photo: AFP/Noel Celis) “EVEN IF I GO HOME NOW, I CAN’T SLEEP”Two months later, angry employees and investors joined protests after the developer failed to make payments on the products, some of which offered yields as high as 10 per cent.One fund investor, who identified himself as Mr Hu, rode a train for 20 hours in a hard berth seat to join protesters outside Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen. The hardware factory worker from Henan province initially invested 100,000 yuan after being pitched by Evergrande staff.When the 7 per cent fund paid off, he took out a loan to boost his investment to 800,000 yuan. Hu, 31, worried he will not get his money back, said he was willing to stay in Shenzhen until he does.“Even if I go home now, I can’t sleep well and eat well,” he said. “I might as well stay here and support other protesters.”Hui, at one time one of China’s richest people, set up a separate investment unit known as Evergrande Wealth in 2015 to seek new funding sources for his sprawling businesses that range from condominiums to electric vehicles and bottled water. Evergrande Wealth is known as an independent wealth manager, which is among the least regulated corners of China’s sprawling shadow banking system.Largely untouched by a government clampdown on most forms of non-bank financing, the industry has grown into a major source of funding for cash-strapped Chinese companies by selling high-yield products to affluent investors.Evergrande capitalised on the loose regulations, selling the funds to about 70,000 retail investors even though these debt instruments, known as private publication notes, are usually intended for institutional investors or individuals with at least 1 million yuan to invest. Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment.RED FLAGSThe high-yield products have raised red flags from regulators in the past. Banking watchdog Chairman Guo Shuqing has warned that if any product offers a return above 6 per cent, it should raise questions. If it is higher than 8 per cent, it is dangerous, and if it tops 10 per cent, investors should prepare to lose every penny.To be sure, the trust funds are closely regulated and there have been no signs of investor protest yet, unlike with Evergrande’s other wealth products.Anger about the missed payments on the Evergrande funds bubbled over this month as some investors vented on social media while others trekked to Evergrande’s glass-tower headquarters. There they were greeted by a dozen police officers and security guards in riot gear brandishing plastic shields.One investor, Mr Wang, had been in Shenzhen for two days, saying he could not bear to tell his elderly parents what had happened. He did not care about the interest payments and was just hoping to get his 100,000 yuan investment back.When asked about the company’s repayment options, including discounted properties or deferred cash over 30 months, Wang just muttered along with his friend: “It’s a fraud.” Source: Bloomberg/dv Related Topics Evergrande China investment Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...Advertisement Expand to read the full story CNA Sections AsiaSingaporeBusinessCNA InsiderLifestyleLuxuryCNA938 LiveCommentaryInteractivesLive TVSportWorldSpecial Reports About CNA About UsAdvertise With UsContact UsCorrespondentsPresentersMediacorp Network Pressed for time?
